How the MTA can defeat the bus-fare deadbeats — and reward the rest of us,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Nearly half of New York City bus riders aren’t paying their fares — and the biggest problem with this mass-scale casual theft isn’t the $300 million-plus a year it costs the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

No, the real crisis is that public contempt for the situation will eventually result in huge cuts to bus service.

Why should taxpayers pay to subsidize a service if riders don’t care enough to chip in?

But this isn’t hard to fix.

You could run a sociology course on all the proffered reasons that 47.8% of riders are now boarding for free, up from about ¼ before the pandemic.

People are poor.

We’ve become anti-social.

Trust in government is low.

Bus service is bad.

But the primary reason is obvious: People think they can get away with it.

And they’re right: The $100 civil fine levied for evading the $2.90 fare means a scofflaw would have to get caught once every 35 times he skips the fare box for it to be worth it to actually pay.

That’s if he even bothers to pay the fine at all: Nearly half of the fare-evasion fines levied by the city go unpaid.

(Yes, the MTA can garnish your wages or your tax refund, but that assumes you work in the legal economy, not for cash, and that you file state taxes.)

Yet police focus most of their fare-evasion energy on the subway, so the MTA sends civilian “Eagle Teams” onto buses to ensure that fares are paid.

With only 200 such workers covering thousands of buses on 327 bus routes, that tiny task force is not much of a deterrence against a million fare evaders every day.

They’d have to give out 28,000 tickets daily to change the average fare evader’s cost-benefit calculus — when the entire transit system, both subways and buses, issues only about 600 violations a day.

High-profile media events, like the MTA’s mass-scale surge of fare enforcers on a few bus lines last week, won’t change people’s rational calculus.

The MTA did a similar high-profile crackdown during last August’s slow-news season, and . . . nothing happened.

The only thing that will change people’s minds is if they know that a penalty will be swift, certain and actually collected.

How?

First, as the MTA phases out the MetroCard in favor of tap cards, it should switch to an electronic “proof of payment” fare-enforcement system, as other global systems use.

“Proof of payment” means that a fare enforcer doesn’t have to witness you evading the fare, or, on the pay-before-you-board “select bus,” ask for an easily lost paper receipt.

An Eagle Team member (or police officer) could just board a bus and ask, say, every fourth passenger to tap his card against a hand-held inspection machine to prove that he paid.

This would speed enforcement.

No longer would inspectors on “select bus” lines hold all passengers hostage on the bus, as people fumble for their receipts.

Second, introduce European-style, on-the-spot fine payment.

That is, if you didn’t pay your fare, you’ll pay it right now, the moment you’re caught, plus a high penalty.

This wouldn’t mean introducing a new fine for people without a credit card to tap or ready cash.

For example, a first-time (or first-time-caught) bus-fare evader could pay an immediate fine to the Eagle Team inspector of, say, $50 instead of the full, current $100 penalty.

Or, she could choose to receive a ticket and pay the full $100 fine later, as is the current procedure.

So for trying to save three bucks, you’d face an immediate $50 squeeze if caught, rather than a bill that won’t come due for a while.

Finally, ensure a real penalty for repeat evasion.

Third-time evaders should face a misdemeanor “theft of services” charge — one that comes with an actual punishment.

No, that doesn’t mean jail; it could mean community service, picking up trash.

Although, to stick misdemeanor theft-of-services charges, the state must reform its new evidence-discovery laws, which consume weeks of prosecutorial resources for even minor offenses, as Hannah Meyers described recently.

Success could even bring a reward for bus riders.

Unlike cities like London and Boston, which charge lower fares for their buses than their train systems, New York charges the same fare for both subways and buses, even though buses are slower.

Once we get fare evasion to an acceptable rate — say, below 5% — why not celebrate with a lower bus fare, maybe $2.25 instead of $2.90?

The MTA could advertise this goal on the buses, so that every time a paying passenger sees a freeloader board, he’ll know what that freeloader is costing us all.

Ramped up enforcement drives slight drop in bus fare evasion,2024-09-24 00:00:00,"It’s estimated the MTA loses nearly $700 million a year to fare evasion, over $300 million on buses, which were free during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“It has been something that has been hard to stem the tide, especially with opening the back door during the COVID period and the trend has continued,” New York City Transit Interim President Demetrius Crichlow said at the agency’s committee meeting Monday.

What You Need To Know Fare evasion on buses has grown from 38% of riders not paying at the start of 2023 to nearly 50% by the end of June 2024



The first two weeks of increased enforcement saw 3,200 more paid rides a day, a 4.6% increase on routes



The MTA said education is also part of the initiative and even riders on TikTok are helping spread the word about paying

The past year has seen a large increase in people not paying. It starts at approximately 38% of riders at the beginning of 2023, rising to nearly 50% by the end of June, despite issuing more than 40,000 summonses from January through mid-August.

But now, the MTA says it is making progress due to increased enforcement, with unarmed EAGLE Teams in plainclothes on buses. The members note who isn’t paying and taking those riders off at a central location to be met by the NYPD.

“Even in our first two weeks as we were [finding out] our deployment, we saw an increase of 3,200 paid rides per day,” Crichlow said. “And a 4.6% increase in paid rides on routes where we were enforcing the fare.”

Since this started Aug. 28, payments even increased on routes without enforcement.

The MTA said they are getting help to get the word out on TikTok, numerous riders warning others through posts about the new initiative.

But some transit advocates say this punishes poverty.

“It’s one thing to have a functional proof of payment system, which New York does not yet have, and to occasionally check to make sure that somebody who can afford to pay has paid,” Danny Pearlstein, director of policy and communications at Riders Alliance, said. “It’s another thing to waste the time of everyone already riding the slowest buses in America.”

But officials insist it’s not just about enforcement, noting EAGLE team members physically block people from boarding through the back door and get people to pay on the spot.

They also have digital signage throughout the system reminding riders to pay the fare.

“Before launching this initiative on buses, we had a day of action where we spoke to riders particularly at these locations and said we were going to be changing things up so there was no surprise,” Crichlow said.

Come January, the penalties will change in an effort to be more equitable.

A first offense will come with a warning, but the fine for a second will increase from $100 to $150. However, if an individual qualifies and enrolls in the low-income discounted fare program, Fair Fares, they can have their fine forgiven.",https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/traffic_and_transit/2024/09/24/mta-touts-drop-in-bus-fare-evasion-amid-crackdown
M.T.A. Says No More Free Bus Rides for Fare Evaders,2024-08-29 00:00:00,"On Thursday, a group of eight police officers and eight transit workers stood waiting for a crosstown bus on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, some with ticket-writing pads in hand.

When the bus arrived, they boarded and led a woman in black scrubs out onto the street and issued her a $100 summons for skipping the fare. The officers and transit officials had singled the woman out after receiving cues from an undercover inspector who was observing riders on the bus.

The woman appeared stunned and burst into tears. She was still crying when she boarded the next M96 bus that pulled up. This time she paid her fare.

While most of New York’s enforcement initiatives have focused on the subway, fare evasion is much more prevalent on city buses, and transit leaders this week expanded efforts on buses, where one out of two passengers fails to pay. According to the latest statistics from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency lost $285 million in 2022 to fare evasion in the subway system and $315 million on buses, even as roughly twice as many passengers rode the trains.",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/nyregion/mta-fare-evasion-bus.html
Cracking down on fare evasion on New York’s subways and buses,2024-05-28 09:00:00+00:00,"New Yorkers have a lot of reasons for dodging bus and subway fares, but their habits are beginning to derail the transit system’s bottom line.

Some people truly can’t afford to pay for their trips. Some may have gotten used to free bus rides at the start of the pandemic four years ago. For others, it’s an inconvenience to swipe their MetroCards, or they simply feel entitled to a free ride.

This spring, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority hopes to finally begin collecting potentially billions of dollars in new revenue from congestion pricing after more than a decade of delays. But the recalcitrance of riders who refuse to pay is starting to add up.

People who pay say, ‘Why am I a sucker seeing everybody walk through the gate?’ MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber

“It’s a problem because it demoralizes riders. People who pay say, ‘Why am I a sucker seeing everybody walk through the gate?’” MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber told City & State. “It creates a sense of disorder in a public space where you really can’t have that feeling. People are not going to feel safe if they see everybody breaking the rules before they even get on the subway.”

Like most transit agencies across the country, the MTA depends heavily on the fare box to make up its more than $19 billion annual operating budget. Now transit ridership is merely two-thirds its previous highs before the pandemic and fares are down 26% from the first few months of 2020.

Lieber estimated that the transit system lost $200 million to $300 million from fare evasion before the pandemic. But by 2023, that number grew to $690 million in lost fare revenue according to a Citizens Budget Commission report. Even though the MTA collected $5 billion from paying subway and bus customers, fare evasion amounted to 14% of the agency’s potential pool of revenue and nearly 4% of its operating budget, according to MTA and City Council records.

Now, fare evasion is happening more frequently, especially on buses.

Bus fare evasion cost the MTA $315 million last year alone, which was more than the $285 million in subway fare evasion. In the last three months of 2023, 45% of local bus riders did not pay their fare to board, up from 21% in the last quarter of 2019. By comparison, 13% of subway riders skipped turnstiles over the same period last year, up from 5% at the end of 2019. (Several experts attributed the discrepancy to the fact that many buses did not collect fares during the pandemic and passengers in some areas may have gotten used to not paying them.)

Passengers who don’t pay their fares have stressed the MTA’s daily operations and its plans for the future, officials said.

“If you’re relying on revenue to come in and pay workers at the MTA to run the service that’s desperately needed and it doesn’t come in, that puts the transit system in not a great place and fares have to go up for everyone else who is paying,” said Kate Slevin, executive vice president at the Regional Plan Association.

Solutions that alter rider behavior have not been easy. In 2022, the MTA convened a task force of transit experts to study the root causes of fare and toll evasion and find ways to reduce them. Their recommendations included modernizing turnstiles and other entrances, downgrading enforcement so that a first offense earns a warning before a fine or summons, and expanding the income eligibility for its underused Fair Fares program so another 500,000 passengers would qualify for discounted service. State lawmakers adopted several measures in the state budget this year, but they didn’t extend a free bus pilot on one line in each borough. And the city must include more money in its budget in order to pay for an extension of Fair Fares.

“Fair Fares can address some of the (fare evasion issues),” said state Sen. Leroy Comrie, chair of the Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Committee. “It has not been advertised well for a lot of people. We need to make sure the Fair Fares program is capturing them and embracing them and they’re actually using it.”

The most visible way the MTA has sought to fight fare evasion has been through law enforcement. In the first few years of the pandemic, transit leaders urged New York City Mayor Eric Adams to deploy more police officers underground to combat a rash of assaults. But MTA officials also asked police to tackle fare evasion and requested another 800 officers in March. So far this year, police have arrested 1,700 people for fare evasion and ticketed another 28,000 people.

Lieber has been happy with the police presence in the transit system and wants district attorneys to press charges against repeat offenders.

“It’s stealing from other New Yorkers. It’s destroying the value system of our shared public spaces. And most importantly, it creates this sense of illegality and disorder in the system,” he said. “When you have people who can pay, and in many cases, wealthy people in wealthy neighborhoods who just make it a habit to waltz in with their $8 latte in their hand and not pay, I think that it’s time for the DAs to take action and I hope they will.”

But the reliance on the New York Police Department has brought its own set of problems.

Police have disproportionately arrested Black and Latino riders, who made up 93% of those arrested for fare evasion and two-thirds of those who received tickets in the fourth quarter of 2022. Bus riders who used the MTA’s new payment system, OMNY, complained that police ticketed them even though the system granted free rides after reaching their weekly fare cap. And the city’s migrants have said they have been increasingly targeted by police and arrested for illegally entering the subway, which could spiral into deportations.

The extra enforcement hasn’t been cheap either. Overtime pay for police in the subways skyrocketed from $4 million in 2022 to $155 million last year, Gothamist reported.

The aggressive spate of enforcement has disturbed transit advocates who questioned whether fare evasion should be criminalized in the first place. Danny Pearlstein, policy and communications director of the transit advocacy group Riders Alliance, said the hysteria over the crisis went back to the first campaign for congestion pricing more than a decade ago that sought to convince drivers to pay a new toll.

“Drivers should not support congestion pricing, so the logic goes, unless every last rider has the fare extracted from them,” he said. “And that doesn’t make any sense. It’s incredibly expensive to extract a fare from people who can’t and won’t pay.”

Pearlstein would like to see an expansion of Fair Fares as well as adding all-door boarding to buses and the extension of a free bus pilot on more lines in order to entice more riders to use city buses.

“It’s clear now after the pandemic that we can’t rely on fares as much as we did before. The (subways and buses) aren’t going to be crush-loaded with people who are going to offices five days a week,” he said. “I don’t see the Legislature funding free fares because that will cost several billion, but in the incremental way budgets are made, it’s possible we could arrive at that over several rounds from a fare-dependent system to one that is independent (of) fares.”",https://www.cityandstateny.com/policy/2024/05/cracking-down-fare-evasion-new-yorks-subways-and-buses/396821/
MTA Rolls Out More Rented Guards to Beat Fare Evasion,2024-08-14 00:00:00,"The MTA has doubled the ranks of private security guards posted near subway station emergency exits that officials call the “superhighway of fare evasion.”

Budget documents show that the MTA expects to spend more than $35 million through next year on increasing to 1,000 the number of unarmed security guards whose mere presence at the gates is intended to slow the stream of fare-beaters who use them as free entrances.

The MTA estimates that it takes a $700 to $800 million hit annually from nonpayment in the subways, buses and commuter railroads, as well as at its tolled bridges and tunnels.

“It does deter someone when they see someone in uniform standing in front of the gate, so I think this is a good idea,” said David Jones, an MTA board member who served on the agency’s Blue-Ribbon Panel on Fare and Toll Evasion. “And I can assure you that it costs vastly less than a fully trained police officer.”

The private guards, contracted through the security firm Allied Universal, are rotated “strategically” among stations, an MTA spokesperson said. The agency estimated in May that fare evasion fell by 20% to 30% at the 50 stations where they were initially deployed in 2022.

While the NYPD has also increased the number of officers in stations and on platforms in recent years — boosting the number of summonses and arrests for fare evasion, data show — the new, unarmed station guards lack law-enforcement authority.

Instead, the blue-shirted gate guards in safety vests stand near emergency exits. Several told THE CITY that they are instructed to avoid confrontations while directing would-be farebeaters to the turnstiles.

“If we weren’t here, there would be someone standing here literally where I am next to the gate, just allowing people to come in,” said a security guard at the Third Avenue-149th Street station, who asked to not have his name published.

NYPD officers are still using their enforcement authority, department data shows. Through the first six months of 2024, the number of “theft of service” summonses for not paying the fare has gone up 9% from the same period in 2023, with close to 69,000 issued through the end of June. The 42nd Street-Port Authority Bus Terminal station had the most among the 472 stations, with 2,072.

‘People Need to Get Places’

MTA Chairperson and CEO Janno Lieber has said complaints from regular riders about fare-beating hit him hardest.

“The people that I hear from the most, that make the most impact on me, are people of limited means who are frustrated when they see somebody else push by them without paying on the bus or push in through an exit gate in the subway,” he said after the agency’s July board meeting. “We owe it to those people who live their lives playing by the rules not to make them feel like suckers.”

After the blue-ribbon panel last year issued recommendations on how to reduce what it called “crisis levels” of fare evasion, the MTA said it has made some progress on curbing the practice.

But the agency faces an even greater challenge on the buses, where transit officials estimate that nearly half of its nearly 2 million riders do not pay to ride.

Among the new subway strategies are design changes to 1,400 turnstiles at 100 stations that prevent people from pulling the devices in the reverse direction and slide through without paying, delaying opening of some emergency gates by 15 seconds and bringing in additional security guards.

“It’s a step,” Jones, the board member, said of the guards. “I don’t think it’s going to be a panacea.”

Across stations in Brooklyn, Manhattan and The Bronx, THE CITY spotted people trying to unsuccessfully talk their way past the security guards at the emergency gates, but also observed groups of people waiting for unattended doors to be propped open so they could enter without paying while out of sight of two police officers on the platform.

“I ain’t got it,” said Antoine Brown, 38, who waited for a gate to open at Jay Street-MetroTech in Downtown Brooklyn.

At 34th Street-Penn Station, straphanger Damion Samuels said he sympathizes with New Yorkers who beat the fare.

“The city is becoming increasingly difficult to live in, people need to get places,” he said. “People have to do what they have to do.”

At the Third Avenue-149th Street stop, William Walvin, 27, stood by the turnstiles to the northbound platform waiting, unsuccessfully, for the guards to let him into the station.

“If I go through when the gates open, I’m going to get a ticket from the cops and I’m not trying to get a ticket,” said Walvin, who is unemployed. “So I have to go directly to the guards and be honest and say, ‘Listen, right now I don’t got it and I’m just trying to get a ride.’”",https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/08/14/mta-security-guards-fare-evasion/
Can a psychologist stop fare evaders? MTA mulls new strategy to save millions,2024-06-01 14:57:20+00:00,"The MTA wants to take a new approach to curbing fare evasion and numerous failed attempts.

This time, instead of installing gadgets to stop fare beaters, they're considering hiring a psychologist to get into their minds in hopes of ""shrinking"" the expensive problem.

The MTA website is now advertising an RFP — that’s request for proposal — for a “behaviorist” who can dig into the societal trends behind an epidemic of non-payment.

MTA executives have said they're in a high stakes battle. While only 13.6% of subway riders are fare evaders, nearly half of all bus passengers skip paying. It all adds up to a staggering projected loss of $700 million this year.

""We have to win or else the system is gone,"" MTA CEO Janno Lieber warned at a recent board meeting.

Some riders were skeptical of the psychological approach.

“I mean, if the behavior analyst can come up with a solution, I don’t think it’s gonna change the way people think,” said Sheila Sessums, a Bronx resident waiting for an uptown M102 bus in Manhattan.

The MTA's application for an expert seeks someone who can conduct research on the motivations and devise behavioral interventions to stop fare evasion.

The MTA is only thinking about the idea. With the potential of paying the consultant between half-a-million and $1 million over a six-month period.

“The MTA is advancing a holistic approach to address fare evasion that the blue ribbon panel recommended in 2023, including efforts to reinforce the importance of paying your fare and making it easier for customers to pay,"" an MTA spokesperson told News 4.

But the transit union said making buses free might be a better route than solving rider psychology.

“I don’t know how that’s gonna help a person who can’t pay the fare — telling them to feel good and then telling them get off the bus isn’t gonna really help,"" JP Patafio, of the Transport Workers Local 100, said Friday.

Transit officials presented the board with analysis on why people evade the fare, and they're already addressing a known weakness: closing open subway gates that have led to what the MTA chairman calls crime of opportunity.

MTA Steps Up Bus Fare Evasion Enforcement Amid Debate,2024-08-29 17:15:30-04:00,"Opinions from New Yorkers seemed split on Thursday as the NYPD and MTA ramped up fare evasion enforcement on NYC buses across the five boroughs.

Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

The NYPD and MTA ramped up fare evasion enforcement on NYC buses across the five boroughs on Thursday — but not all New Yorkers were keen on the crackdown.

amNewYork Metro was on the Upper East Side and in the Bronx on Aug. 29 as police and MTA Eagle Teams — some in plain clothes — vigorously scoured buses on both 97th Street and 5th Avenue and East Fordham and Grand Concourse.

Task force members removed those who did not pay for public transport from the bus, handing out tickets costing the violators $100 a pop.

“Since we’ve been doing this, we’ve watched people take out their card and pay, so it’s not that it’s an issue of whether or not people have the ability to pay, they’re just choosing to evade it,” Interim President of MTA Demetrius Crichlow said. “They are doing all of the things that New York provides, but they’re not paying us.”

This comes as the MTA say they have already been zeroing in on fare evasion, with weekly summonses going from 387 in January of 2024 to 2,263 in August.

As both officers and MTA security agents handed out fliers on the surge and inspected incoming buses, some commuters waiting at the stop applauded the enforcement — stating that they are sick of paying when others get away with free rides.

“I ride public transportation all the time, and I see fare evaders all the time, and it’s just not fair to those of us who pay the fare to have others come on for free,” Susan Tilson said.

Others agreed, arguing that with congestion pricing halted, the city needs to make up the cash in order to keep the trains and buses chugging.

“I do think it’s beneficial to have enforcement. I think that the MTA needs to have the fares paid, so I think that benefits everybody,” Sherril Fay said. “As I understand, the bus drivers are not encouraged to be the enforcers, and I totally understand that. I think that it’s not their place to do so.”

Some riders, however, believe the crackdown is more trouble than its worth — holding up buses and making people late along the way.

“This is useless, all they are doing is holding up the bus,” one rider said.

In one incident, a woman — who spoke with the help of a translator — said she was digging in her pockets to find change when the bus driver told her to move along and an MTA enforcement agent slapped her with a $100 fine. The woman lifted a small bag filled with silver coins to underscore her intentions.

In another incident, a man was issued a ticket for sneaking onboard a bus only for him to go right back on and once again not pay — only to get booted a second time.

NYPD Chief of Transit Michael Kemper told amNewYork Metro that cracking down on fare evasion citywide is far more important than merely dishing out summonses but also about catching dangerous criminals.

According to Kemper, gun arrests in the subway system are up 76.5% this year, which he attributes to stopping turnstile hopers.

“The public has to enter the buses lawfully through lawful means. That’s either through paying their fare, or, if you can’t afford your fare, through the fair fares program, that offers riders discounted rates, and also letting them know that if you don’t, there’s a chance that you’re going to be stopped by the police or MTA Eagle team,” Chief Kemper said. “You might get away with it today, you might get away with it tomorrow, but you will not get away with it the next day.”

NYC subway using AI to track fare evasion,2023-07-20 12:44:19+00:00,"Surveillance software that uses artificial intelligence to spot people evading fares has been quietly rolled out to some of New York City’s subway stations and is poised to be introduced to more by the end of the year, according to public documents and government contracts obtained by NBC News.

The system, which the city and its transit authority haven’t previously acknowledged by name, uses third-party software that its maker has touted as a way to engage law enforcement to help crack down on fare evasion.

The system was in use in seven subway stations in May, according to a report on fare evasion published online by the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which oversees New York City’s public transportation. The MTA expects that by the end of the year, the system will expand by “approximately two dozen more stations, with more to follow,” the report says. The report also found that the MTA lost $690 million to fare evasion in 2022.

Joana Flores, an MTA spokesperson, said the AI system doesn’t flag fare evaders to New York police, but she declined to comment on whether that policy could change. A police spokesperson declined to comment.

Tim Minton, the MTA’s communications director, said the system tracks fare evasion to figure out how much money the subway isn’t collecting.

“We’re using it essentially as a counting tool,” Minton said. “The objective is to determine how many people are evading the fare and how are they doing it.”

Minton said the videos are stored on the MTA’s servers and are kept “for a limited period.” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office announced last year that the city’s transit systems had more than 10,000 surveillance cameras.

Use of the software adds to what some privacy advocates see as a growing surveillance apparatus developing in New York City.

“This is a moment where movement around the city has never been more surveilled,” said Albert Fox Cahn, the director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a nonprofit legal group that advocates for privacy rights in New York City.

“We’re already seeing the proliferation of automated license plate readers. We’ve seen data collection on Uber and Lyft histories. We see tens of thousands of cameras accessible to the NYPD when people are walking about in public,” Cahn said. “So it’s increasingly becoming a city where there’s no way to navigate it privately.”

The software was created by the Spanish company AWAAIT, Flores confirmed. AWAAIT declined to comment.

A promotional video for AWAAIT’s fare evasion software, created by a Spanish company that operates Barcelona metro trains, depicts a system in which an AWAAIT system was initially used to scan riders going through the metro system and send photos of people it determined were fare evaders to the smartphones of nearby station agents.

Assurances from the MTA that the software wouldn’t be used to aid law enforcement have done little to encourage some privacy and civil rights advocates, who were already alarmed over previous efforts to crack down on fare evasion.

In 2019, city police patrol officers were instructed to ticket most fare evaders rather than arrest them if they could provide identification and passed checks through the police department’s Domain Awareness System, a central hub of surveillance and crime information overseen by the NYPD Counterterrorism Bureau.

New York has increased the number of police officers stationed in subway stations since last year, and arrests have steadily risen, as well. The police department has historically arrested Black and Latino riders for fare evasion at far greater rates than those of other races, prompting allegations of racism.

Molly Griffard, a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society, a law firm that advocates for social justice, said enforcing fare evasion often ends up targeting the poor.

“It’s really unfortunate that rather than thinking about how the city and state can be making these services more available, more accessible to the public, they’re spending all this time and money on enforcement mechanisms to try to get money from the lowest-income New Yorkers,” Griffard said.

A heavily redacted MTA contract for the AI system from July 2022, which Cahn acquired through a Freedom of Information Law request and shared with NBC News, shows that the system was first tested in New York City in 2020, with more stations added in 2021. The exact number of stations is redacted. GovSpend, a database of government spending records, shows that the MTA made two purchases in 2021 for “AWAAIT Video Analytics Fare Evasion Software,” for a combined $35,335.

"Fare Evasion Surges on N.Y.C. Buses, Where 48% of Riders Fail to Pay",2024-08-26 00:00:00,"Every weekday in New York City, close to one million bus riders — roughly one out of every two passengers — board without paying. The skipped fares are a crucial and growing loss of revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is under severe financial pressure.

New York’s long-running fare evasion problem, among the worst of any major city in the world, has intensified recently; before the pandemic, only about one in five bus riders skipped the fare.

Yet public officials have done relatively little to collect the lost revenue from bus riders. Instead, they have focused almost exclusively on the subway system, where waves of police officers and private security guards have been deployed to enforce payment, even as fare evasion rates on trains are dwarfed by those on buses.

During the first three months of this year, 48 percent of bus riders did not pay, according to the latest available statistics from the transit authority, while 14 percent of subway riders evaded fares.

Half of NYC Bus Riders Skip Fares as MTA Revenue Crisis Deepens,2024-08-01 16:00:04-04:00,"Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

Nearly half of MTA bus riders are not paying the $2.90 fare, and the MTA is admitting its attempts to stop the problem have not been particularly effective.

During the first quarter of 2024, 47.8% of the MTA’s 2 million bus riders skipped the fare — an immense increase from just over 20% seen in the last quarter before the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020.

The MTA places the genesis of the problem, which is imperiling agency finances, on the COVID-19 pandemic: bus fares were effectively eliminated for months in 2020 as the coronavirus rampaged through the city, as front-door boarding was eliminated in an effort to protect bus operators from contracting the virus, which killed over 100 members of Transport Workers Union Local 100.

“The problem is that habit of not paying for the buses, which got into people during COVID, has not left,” MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said at a press conference following the MTA’s monthly board meeting on Wednesday. “And so, we do need to do something to reestablish the principle that we’ve all gotta pay, we’ve all gotta be respectful of each other.”

That is somewhat belied, however, by the fact that fare evasion has grown consistently since fare payment was re-established, according to operational metrics published by the MTA.

In the first quarter that fares were re-introduced, fare evasion was barely higher than it was pre-COVID, but in almost every quarter since the prevalence has grown at a quick clip.

Fare evasion is expected to cost the agency up to $800 million in foregone revenue annually over the next few years. And to be sure, the MTA has drawn up numerous detailed plans to combat the problem on the subway, where only about 13.6% of riders were skipping the fare in the first quarter — still much higher than transit bigs want, to be sure.

Thousands of cops have flooded into the subway system partially in a bid to stop farebeaters, as have unarmed private security guards manning turnstiles and emergency exits; the number of summonses issued for fare evasion has more than doubled since the start of 2022.

The MTA has reconfigured subway turnstiles to prevent “back-cocking,” where they’re pulled in the reverse direction to allow riders to slip through without paying, and is piloting delays to opening emergency exits that agency brass say “opportunistic” fare evaders walk through when they may have otherwise paid. Perhaps grandest of all, the MTA is seeking to completely redesign its turnstiles to feature tall, middle-out gates that are much harder to jump.

A question of enforcement

Plans are not so clear-cut for the bus, where the main effort at reining in fare evasion centers on deploying fare inspectors called EAGLE Teams that can board select or local buses to enforce payment, as well as at bus stop “hubs” where many lines converge. Cops can also enforce payment on buses.

Lieber on Wednesday said the agency is devising new strategies to combat fare evasion on buses, though didn’t get into specifics on what those are. He noted that the “omnipresence” approach to policing embraced in the subway won’t work on buses: with 5,800 buses making thousands of stops across over 300 individual routes, there’s simply not enough cops to be everywhere.

“We’ve gotta be strategic, because we cannot put a cop or an Eagle team member on every bus,” said Lieber. “So it has to be effective enough to get the message across.”

Bus fare evasion is just one financial pressure facing the MTA in the next few years, with the agency facing more than $400 million annual deficits starting in 2027. Besides fare evasion, the MTA is facing lower-than-expected revenues from real estate taxes, while the financial picture doesn’t even account for what could be hundreds of millions in foregone revenue stemming from the pause on congestion pricing.

"After $690 Million in Fare Evasion, M.T.A. Looks Past Enforcement",2023-06-05 00:00:00,"For years, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has mostly relied on the same approach to deter people from sneaking into New York City’s subways without paying. As passengers trickle in, police officers stand next to turnstiles and write tickets to those who jump them.

Yet even after a dramatic increase in enforcement, the transit system lost $690 million to fare evasion last year, officials say. Now, the M.T.A. is grappling with a more existential question that is not about how to crack down on fare evasion, but about whether criminal enforcement is the right approach at all.

A report unveiled by the authority last month proposed a range of new solutions, including funneling more resources onto buses, where most fare evasion occurs, boosting a program that subsidizes the cost of public transit for low-income New Yorkers, posting more advertisements urging riders to pay, and adding new fare gates that are harder to climb.

While some riders who do pay feel cheated by the idea of letting others off the hook, left-leaning politicians and advocates for poor New Yorkers have denounced aggressive policing because they say it unfairly targets the city’s most vulnerable people and, crucially, is not actually effective.",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/nyregion/mta-fare-evasion.html

I saw many people jump turnstiles, and I’ll confess that I cheated once myself: As teenagers, a friend and I squeezed through the gate together at Shea Stadium to save $1. It seemed like a normal New York thing to do.

Until it didn’t.

As part of the city’s crackdown on crime in the 1990s, the subway system became a cleaner and safer place. I saw very few people jump turnstiles in New York in the early 2000s. The same was true in Washington.

It is not true anymore. For the past few years, fare beating has again become a regular part of public transit. I’ve watched people do it just a few feet away from powerless transit workers looking directly at them.",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/briefing/fare-evasion-new-york-bus-subway.html

NEW YORK (WABC) -- With almost half of New York City bus riders not paying to ride, a crackdown on bus fare evasion got underway Thursday, and scofflaws were hit with fines.

A warning was sent to riders earlier this week that enforcement was set to begin and they needed to pay the fare.

Eyewitness News cameras were rolling Thursday as the crackdown began in earnest: Riders were pulled off a bus after it was found that they allegedly did not pay their fares by EAGLE teams, backed up by the NYPD. EAGLE members work to spot bus fare evaders.

When the doors opened up at East 97th Street and Fifth Avenue, team members asked the customers to get off the bus and summons were immediately issued.

The interim president of the MTA, Demetrius Crichlow, said that what Eyewitness News saw was not out of the ordinary.

""It's not a surprise. I think the one change is the overt and covert operation. We have EAGLE team members at different locations, and NYPD officers with them. But, a different approach is having people who are not in uniform riding with our customers and then being identified as someone who did not pay their fare,"" Crichlow said.

While fare evaders saw penalties for not playing by the rules, EAGLE team members walked up and down bus aisles, letting riders know a fare is required to hop on and that enforcement will be increased.

The MTA says this summer, 48% of bus riders are not paying. That's more than just before COVID in January 2020. Riders Eyewitness News spoke to said people should just pay the fare.

""This has been going on for a while, I've seen it,"" Michelle R., a rider, said. ""One time I was riding on the bus and a guy was sitting next to me and he was taking people off the bus because they hadn't paid the fare.""

Jamal Jones, a rider, said: ""I've seen those guys and ladies walk through and I think, it will be my luck the police will come get me. Meanwhile, 15, 20 others will walk through.""

Sherrill Fay said fellow riders should just pay up. ""I am sure there are circumstances where there can be concessions made, but that's not up to me to make those decisions.""

Last month, the MTA said fare evasion was to blame for projected budget deficits in the next four years. That's added to the billions missed out on with the pause on congestion pricing.

MTA officials said 41 of the 314 bus routes in Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island were targeted on Thursday.

Officials said bus routes in Brooklyn will be enforced on Friday.

Police are still searching for the attacker in the Washington Heights subway stabbing.

MTA bringing on more unarmed gate guards to deter fare evasion on subway,2024-08-14 17:30:23-04:00,"Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

The MTA is expanding its deployment of unarmed guards standing sentry at subway turnstiles to deter fare evasion.

A spokesperson for the transit agency said it will bring aboard another 500 gate guards, bringing the total deployment to 1,000 guards deployed throughout the system to fare evasion hotspots. The guards, who work for security contractor Allied Universal, are assigned to work outside emergency exit gates, which transit bigwigs call the “superhighway of fare evasion” as a stream of farebeaters tend to enter through the door whenever it’s opened.

As of May, guards were deployed at 50 stations at any given time, and the MTA says stations with deployments have seen decreases in fare evasion by up to 30% since the guards were first deployed late in 2022.

The extra deployment of the guards — who are not deputized as law enforcement but are intended as a deterrent — is set to cost $35 million. The news was first reported by nonprofit news site The City.

The MTA is struggling with a growing prevalence of fare evasion, complicating the post-COVID recovery of the mass transit system. The agency says fare evasion costs it up to $800 million annually in foregone revenue; in the first quarter of 2024, turnstile hoppers accounted for nearly 13.6% of subway riders.

Besides gate guards, the NYPD has surged its presence by thousands of officers into the subway system. The MTA is also reconfiguring turnstiles to prevent “back-cocking” and piloting delays to the opening of emergency exits, and is also seeking to redesign its turnstile to make it harder to jump.

Nonetheless, fare evasion remains a much larger problem for the MTA on the bus, where nearly half of riders are not paying the fare. The MTA’s main attempts to deter farebeating on the bus involve deploying fare inspectors called EAGLE Teams to local and select buses as well as large bus stop hubs, but the agency admits its strategy hasn’t been particularly effective.",https://www.amny.com/transit/mta-unarmed-guards-subway-fare-evasion/
MTA tests new strategies to combat fare evasion as losses mount,2024-05-23 00:00:00,"The MTA board Wednesday got an update on the agency’s efforts to fight fare evasion, a problem that has grown.

“I say it’s at least $700 million. It may be upwards of that,” MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber said for the whole system. “But the preliminary estimates would put it in that $700-to-$800-million range.”

What You Need To Know The MTA is using low-tech methods like high fins on the cabinets of turnstiles to prevent people from pushing themselves over at several stations



Even with increased private security, police presence, summonses and arrests, fare evasion is projected to cost the transit system over $700 million in 2024, according to officials



The MTA wants to expand the use of wide-aisle fare gates to more stations and is establishing a Fare Evasion Lab to test new technology, including proposals for modern fare gates

For subways, it’s increased from $285 million figure in 2022 to a projected loss this year of nearly $360 million. Despite following the recommendations from a blue-ribbon panel on fare evasion last year.

“We are trying to focus on the four pillars that our blue ribbon panelists came up with, which is education, equity, enforcement and environment,” Chantel Cabrera, senior director of Subways Coordination and Solutions, said.

Arrests are up with increased police presence, private security at fare gates, an education campaign and an effort to get those who can’t afford to pay into the low-income fair fares program.

Physical barriers like fins on the sides of turnstiles to prevent people from jumping over them, including at Bowling Green, and addressing weaknesses exposed at the new wide-aisle fare gates in several TikTok videos to prevent piggy-backing or manipulating the sensors.

“We’ve actually decreased the time in which the paddles take to close,” Cabrera said. “We have installed interim barriers in order to prevent any hacking of the sensor trigger. We’ve increased the amount of force that you could put on the paddles before you could break through.”

But Lieber is also concerned about the emergency gates and those going through who can afford to pay.

There’s a pilot to delay their opening by 15 seconds. The agency said at the several fare control areas where it’s been employed, there’s been a 38% reduction in fare evasion through the gate and a 7% reduction in fare evasion overall.

But emergency evacuations are a concern for state code enforcement officials, which the MTA working is working on. But it's not quickly enough for Lieber.

“If it were up to me, we would put the delay on every goddamn gate immediately,” he said.

What the MTA did not address Wednesday is fare evasion on buses, where non-paid ridership ranges from between 40% to more than 55%.

“What seems to have happened is that people got out of the habit of paying during COVID when we closed the front door to protect the bus operators, let everybody get on the back and not pay,” Lieber said. “And we have never gotten back to the levels of payment we were at before COVID.”

Meanwhile, the MTA is planning to expand the fins and the new fare arrays to more stations while they choose a permanent new fare gate system.

The agency also targeting students by creating an incentive program. If they swipe their MetroCards every day, they can be entered into a drawing to win a virtual reality headset.

Lastly, the MTA is also launching a Fare Evasion Lab to try new technologies as they try new modern fare gates from their request for information issued earlier this year.",https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/traffic_and_transit/2024/05/23/mta-tests-new-strategies-to-combat-fare-evasion-as-losses-mount
"NYC using AI to track subway fare evasion, report claims",2023-07-24 21:22:30+00:00,"Seven undisclosed subway stations in New York City are now equipped with some type of artificial intelligence to track fare evasion, according a May report from the city’s transportation authority.

The fare evasion report, which claims subway fare evasion cost the city $285 million in 2022, said that the Metropolitan Transit Authority plans to expand the new technology to another two dozen subway stations by the end of 2023.

The city’s use of the new tools was first reported last week by NBC News.

The report, which is light on details of how the new system works, claims to use AI and “computer technology” to compare the number of paid fares with the actual number of riders. At stations where the new system is used, the evasion rate was measured at about 16%, the report said.

The transportation authority also said its new AI system provides more precise data on when and where fare evasion is occurring, as it operates at all times.

“The MTA thus will develop – for the first time – a much increased ability to pinpoint evasion spikes by station, by day of week, and by time of day,” the report read. “This in turn will support data-driven experiments with new enforcement strategies. With the technology providing reliable ‘before’ and ‘after’ evasion counts, it will be increasingly possible to test new approaches in search of what really works.”

When asked by email for more information about the AI system, such as whether it relies on video cameras or sensors, an MTA spokesperson replied: “The MTA uses this tool to quantify the amount of fare evasion without identifying fare evaders.”

Fare evasion has been rise over the last few years, according to the report: Before the pandemic, evasion rates ranged from 3% to 6% of daily ridership, and on an average weekday, about 400,000 riders of the 3.4 million on average on weekdays do not pay the fare.

Along with expanding its use of AI, the MTA said in the report that modernizing the subway arrays — which includes turnstiles, exit gates and other physical barriers to entering the subway — “is the single most important thing the MTA can do to reduce fare evasion in the subway, saving hundreds of millions of dollars over time.”

More than half of all subway evasion consists of people walking in through the emergency exit gates at the entrance of the subway, with jumping or climbing over the turnstile accounting for about 20% of fare evasion, the report said. “Back-cocking” the turnstile — pulling the tri-wheel back and slipping through the gap — makes up another 16% of fare evasion, and ducking under the turnstile accounts for about 12% of fare evasions.

The new technology arrives after the MTA Board earlier this month announced it will increase subway and bus fares from $2.75 to $2.90, effective Aug. 20.",https://statescoop.com/nyc-ai-subway-fare-evasion/
MTA losing ‘staggering amount of money’ as NYC subway farebeating surges: data,2023-11-22 00:00:00,"Farebeating on the Big Apple’s bus and subway systems is rising, costing the MTA millions of dollars a year — despite a series of major efforts launched to try and stop evaders, new data shows.

Nearly half (41%) of bus riders commuted without paying on routes across the city during the third quarter of 2023, according to the figures from the MTA.

That’s up 4% from when the agency released its exhaustive farebeating report in May.

On the MTA’s Select Bus Service, which operates some of the busiest routes in New York City, fare dodging is as high as 48%, the data shows.

Skipping out on fares is also increasing on the subway system too.

An estimated 14% of subway riders jumped the turnstiles between July and September — the highest level recorded in the five years of MTA data published online.

That’s ticked up from the 13.5% recorded in the May farebeating report. However, fare evasion on the subway has more than doubled from the 5.7% reported in pre-pandemic 2019.

Overall, the MTA estimated that farebeating cost it an eye-watering $690 million last year — a figure that could be topped this year.

“Every time they beat the fare, they’re really beating themselves,” said Lisa Daglian, a member of the blue ribbon panel commissioned by MTA chairman Janno Lieber to track the incidents and publish the extensive report released earlier this year.

“That’s $2.90 that’s not going to service, that’s not going to an extra subway train or an extra bus run,” she said, adding that it is a “staggering amount of money that’s being stolen from the city’s transit system.”

The MTA declined to put a price tag on the current uptick as agency officials are expected to roll out their budget proposal for next year in the coming weeks.

4 4 million New Yorkers are again swiping their MetroCards or tapping their credit cards on OMNY to ride these days. That’s about 70% of the pre-pandemic ridership figure, MTA ridership data shows. Stephen Yang

Lieber, who has run the MTA for two years now, has made combating fare evasion one of his top priorities.

“It’s not just a matter of money, although it is a huge, huge financial issue,” Lieber told The Post’s editorial board this year. “Fare evasion tears at the social fabric as one way to put it.”

Lieber has launched a series of efforts aimed at cutting down on fare evasion, including hiring private security guards to stand watch over emergency exit doors at subway stations and tightening the gearing on the turnstiles to make them harder to wiggle through.

4 Lieber has made combating fare evasion one of his top priorities. James Messerschmidt for NY Post

His highest profile push came when his blue-ribbon commission published its 125-page report that outlined a series of other shorter and longer-term programs that could reign in the losses.

The laundry list of recommendations included:

Launching a major public service advertising campaign in subway stations and on buses to highlight the costs of fare evasion

Hiring 100 new fare inspectors to increase enforcement on buses, particularly the local bus routes

Working with the Department of Education to roll out new curriculum aimed at encouraging public school students to use their city-issued MetroCards instead of hopping the turnstiles

The MTA also signaled it eying the first redesign of turnstiles across the subway system since the MetroCard was introduced three decades ago.

Part of that redesign, officials said, could include incorporating the sorts of high-tech turnstiles commonly used in major European metro systems that are much harder to jump over and slip past — but are still clever enough to allow those in wheelchairs or with bikes and strollers to pass through with ease.

The MTA has not provided a timeline for how long it expects it to take to redesign and replace the gates across the system’s 472 stations, though it would likely take years.

The agency has said that it expects to officially solicit plans from vendors by the end of the year.

Progress elsewhere has been mixed.

There’s been little sign yet of the large-scale PSA effort sought by the commission.

However, the agency said it has hired 85 of the additional 100 requested inspectors.

“As the Blue-Ribbon report noted, the increase in fare evasion seems to reflect a deep-seated culture change since the pandemic – a new attitude among too many New Yorkers that fare evasion is acceptable,” said MTA spokeswoman Joana Flores.

“The MTA knew it would take time to rebuild the right attitudes,” she added. “We are determined to change this, and over time we will.”",https://nypost.com/2023/11/22/metro/farebeating-on-nyc-subways-and-buses-is-rising-data-shows/

NEW YORK (WABC) -- There's a new warning for MTA bus riders who avoid paying the fare.

Mayor Eric Adams said if you don't pay, you'll start getting a summons.

Adams told a radio show Wednesday morning that the city is putting an initiative in place to crack down on MTA fare beaters.

""We are now putting in place an initiative where we are going to crack down on this,"" Adams said on 94.7 FM The Block radio Wednesday morning.

Riders began receiving notifications on Tuesday that fare inspectors will soon be enforcing payment.

The notifications read, ""If you don't pay your fare, you may be asked to exit the bus and may receive a summons.""

The MTA says 48% of bus riders are not paying, more than double than just before COVID in January 2020.

These days, 14% of subway riders aren't paying, up from only 4% back then.



""What folks don't realize is that when you have that large number of people not paying the fare, then it increases the fare for those who are,"" Adams said.

Adams said the initiative, which does not have a start date, will be to ""send the right message that you will pay your fare on the bus, you will pay your fare on the subway, because it is not fair to those New Yorkers who are doing it.""

It comes after the MTA last month noted fare evasion is to blame for $900 million in projected budget deficits in the next four years. Add that to the billions it's missing out on with congestion pricing still paused.

""We let people get out of the habit of paying for buses during COVID,"" said MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber.

Before COVID, Jackie Rodriguez remembers seeing MTA enforcement on the buses making sure those who didn't pay, didn't ride.

""They would see you get on the bus and they would get on and take you right off,"" said Rodriguez, an MTA bus rider.

NYPD officers and MTA enforcement agents are mapping out areas where bus riders are least likely to pay the fare for possible enforcement.

MTA employees, assigned to the EAGLE fare enforcement unit, would spot riders who do not pay the fare. The unarmed officers would escort the fare beaters off the bus at stops staffed by NYPD officers for further enforcement.

The officers could issue summons ranging from $50 to $100. In some cases, they could make an arrest.

In its post, the MTA reminded riders that there are senior and low-income discounts, and fare caps at $34 a week if you use the same device.

Commuter Anthony Beasley suggested even more breaks and incentives, since everything is more expensive than before COVID.

""Maybe give us like four, five days free out of the week, maybe like every other week, it can help us be able to have a living and our dollar could stretch,"" he said.

What Is the Fare Evasion Equation?,2024-09-19 00:00:00,"× Expand Kyle Mazza/NurPhoto via AP Four people, including two bystanders and an NYPD officer, were shot on Sunday after two officers opened fire on a suspect allegedly armed with a knife at a subway station in Brooklyn, New York.

The accounts vary, but the essential threads are these: On Sunday, New York police officers saw a man evade his subway fare and try to board a train at a Brooklyn station. They used a taser on the man; it did not slow him down. The man flashed a knife. The officers shot and wounded four people: the alleged fare evader, one officer, and two bystanders, a middle-aged man and a young woman. For policing specialists with NYPD experience, the incident raised questions about the force’s use of lethal force and its de-escalation tactics. The alleged assailant may face charges of attempted assault and fare evasion.

One of the victims, Gregory Delpeche, remains in critical condition and his family has called for an investigation of the police response. The incident is a tragic but not shocking product of New York City’s aggressive crackdown on fare evasion and subway crime. The shooting has sparked wide protests demanding police be held accountable.

At a Tuesday rally in Brooklyn, protesters also demanded free fares, which would cut down on police interactions over minor infractions. New York is now at a crossroads in the free-fare debate.

Free-fare programs, of course, aren’t free. Last year, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) launched a free-bus program on one route in each of the five boroughs. The authority identified routes based on ridership, fare evasion, and other metrics. The authority planned to add 15 more. But the pilot ends this year, and state lawmakers did not fund an extension of the pilot or an expansion in the new state budget. Who outside the city wants to pay for Big Apple buses? Who will be surprised if an overwhelming number of people see no reason to pay fares on those routes next year?

There might have been plenty of money for these routes and so much more if New York Gov. Kathy Hochul had only allowed congestion pricing to go into effect. The MTA would have had $15 billion to spend on free bus routes and more. But who wants hear suburbanites whining about paying to drive into Midtown in a presidential election year?

The free-fare movement gained traction during the pandemic but has been losing steam as pandemic-era federal funds run out and no one has figured out how to keep the existing programs going without them. Instead, metro-area transit systems are trying to close new budget gaps. In New York, the MTA budget deficit could reach nearly $1 billion in 2026. The answer to the inevitable question of “who pays?” has been less than optimal.

In retrospect, pandemic-era free fares, combined with the calls for permanent elimination of fares, helped contribute to the situation New York and other metro areas all over the country face. Once the lockdowns ended and people returned to public spaces, transit riders decided that free is fine, especially on buses. The worries about transit systems’ financial troubles were met with the stance of “talk to the hand” for some transit riders.

The free-fare movement gained traction during the pandemic but has been losing steam as pandemic-era federal funds run out.

Each day in New York, some 400,000 of those people do not pay their fares. Nearly half of New York bus riders fail to pay their $2.90, and 14 percent of subway riders pay zero dollars. Comments published in a 2023 blue-ribbon report on MTA fare and toll evasion offered a variety of reasons: “I feel like a chump for paying the fare when other riders don’t.” “My dad told me not to pay. He said nobody else is, so I shouldn’t either.”

In Washington, the story is much the same. One Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) rider revealed that some people don’t pay fares to protest late buses. In April, the authority pointed to a 50 percent drop in fare evasion on rail, but did not mention buses. Out West, San Francisco’s new sci-fi-worthy silver gates—price tag $90 million—are more of a challenge, but 20 percent of riders still use creative strategies to get through without paying. In metro Portland, Oregon, TriMet found that about 30 percent of riders did not pay for the system’s MAX light-rail lines.

Even the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority, a standout among the free-fare transit systems, may return to what it calls a “functional free fare.” (No one seems to know what exactly that might mean, but suffice to say it involves money.)

For bus drivers, the long-suffering heroes of public transportation, personal safety comes first. So they largely ignore the people who ignore the fares. That’s likely a reason that the pandemic-installed partitions on WMATA buses have not been removed and drivers hardly make eye contact anymore. As for its rail lines, WMATA has deployed special police to handle fare evasion, harassment, and other crimes.

Backed by the city council, Washington planned to go fare-free on its buses, but the WMATA board backed up Mayor Muriel Bowser, who opposed it and said no at least for the short term, ending the debate. Boston runs free buses on three routes until the city’s pandemic funds run out in 2026. And so on.

If taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society, fares are the price we pay so people don’t have to drive, or walk, or cycle in poorly constructed bike lanes (or none at all) flanked by drivers who just don’t care that they’re there. Transit systems use fares to invest in subway cars, buses, tracks, switches, IT systems, wires, paint, and fare gates. The money pays for the workers who make everything possible: conductors, drivers, engineers, transit police, and cleaning crews. Until there is a brilliant answer to the “who pays” question, American transit systems have to rely on fares to buy and fix stuff and pay the people who do those jobs.

But what is clear is that the MTA will have to find a new response to fare evasion that does not involve blood-streaked subway stations or intensive care units or grieving family, friends, and community members. What is also clear is that congestion pricing needs to be back on the table to enable the MTA to pursue free-fare strategies and devise new responses to fare evasion.

The MTA blue-ribbon panel underlined that fare enforcement efforts still target people of color and marginalized communities. They concluded that police should be out of the fare evasion equation altogether. “There should be a shift over time toward more civilian enforcement and away from enforcement through police-involved encounters.”

On Wednesday night, protesters marched from Union Square, one of the city’s traditional sites for demonstrations, to a subway station blocks away, where they jumped the turnstiles en masse. There were arrests, but for the most part police stood by.

MTA ends free bus pilot as bus fare evasion soars,2024-07-29 00:00:00,"The free bus pilot that was part of last year’s state budget is ending at the end of August.

The five routes, which were strategically placed in disadvantaged communities, were funded by $15 million. The MTA found while ridership increased; it was mostly existing riders using the routes more frequently.

What You Need To Know New York City Transit fare revenue was $73 million lower than projections through June, led by fare evasion on buses



The free bus pilot was funded by $15 million in last year’s budget, but MTA officials felt it didn’t promote riders to pay the fare



The cuts come as the MTA prepares to lay out how the pause in congestion pricing will negatively affect the operating budget

“It’s predominately benefiting existing riders,” Jon Kaufman, the chief of strategic initiatives for the MTA, said. “If your goal is helping with affordability, there are smarter ways to go about it than this.”

With fare evasion hovering around 50% on buses, MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said giving free rides on the Bx 18 A/B, the B60, M116, Q4 and the S46/96 sent the wrong message to riders across all bus routes about paying.

According to officials, the revenue loss affects service.

“But people want great service. That’s what they continue to say to us. They want great service and we want to deliver it,” Interim New York City Transit President Demetrius Crichlow said. “However, you need to do your share and pay the fare.”

While riders will see some new turnstiles designed to fight fare evasion on the subway in the coming months, still a less than rosy financial picture for transit, with fare revenue well below projections.

Losses from fare evasion on buses year-to-date at $69 million alone, according to officials. That, in addition to lower revenue from real estate-related taxes, means the operating budget could take a hit.

“This is not a stable set of situations, and I think as you described, some of this is at the consumer’s behest, fare evasion, some of this is at the interest-rate behest, which is why the real estate market has been so unfavorable to us,” Neal Zuckerman, board member and finance chair for the MTA, said. “But ultimately, we are takers of some very choppy waters.”

Also, the next five-year capital plan is due by Oct. 1, with no known funding source. However, the $15 billion for the current plan is still uncertain amid the pause in congestion pricing, though officials are operating as if it will be there.

“So that it’s either congestion pricing or an alternative source, that doesn’t put additional borrowing on the MTA’s operating budget,” Lieber said.

But if there was additional borrowing, there were warnings that fare and tolls would have to be raised as high as 8% to keep up. The full MTA board will learn more about the immediate effects of the congestion pricing pause on the operating budget on Wednesday.",https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/traffic_and_transit/2024/07/29/free-bus-pilot-ends-amid-rampant-bus-fare-evasion
Fare evasion cost MTA nearly $700M in 2022. These are the measures being considered to combat the issue.,2023-05-17 21:04:18.902000+00:00,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- New York City transit riders’ refusal to pay their fair share is costing the MTA hundred of millions of dollars, with the agency now considering new solutions to an age-old problem that has only grown worse in recent years.

Last April, the MTA announced the formation of a 16-member panel on fare and toll evasion tasked with analyzing the extent of the issue and recommending new ways to discourage fare evasion.

At the time, agency officials projected losses of roughly $500 million in 2022, though research conducted by the panel found the issue to be even worse than expected.

On Wednesday, MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber, alongside panel co-chairs Rosemonde Pierre-Louis and Roger Maldonado, announced that fare evasion cost the agency approximately $690 million last year, representing a 38% increase from the MTA’s initial projections.

“We have found that fare evasion is at crisis levels across the transit system and the problem is much bigger than everyone thinks,” said Pierre-Louis. “Notably, since the pandemic, fare evasion has increased particularly and significantly on both subways and buses.”

“Turning the tide on these sobering numbers is mission critical and we firmly believe that action must be taken now before the damage is irreversible,” she added.

Bus riders were found to be the greatest offenders, with more than one out of every three riders failing to pay their fare last year, costing the agency an estimated $315 million.

Next up were subway riders, who evaded an estimated $285 million in fares by jumping turnstiles and entering through station emergency exit gates. The report found that roughly 400,000 subway riders fail to pay their fares each weekday.

Additionally, the agency lost an estimated $46 million in tolls from drivers using fake or obstructed plates at MTA crossings, an issue that has been prevalent at the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge.

The MTA also estimated losses of roughly $44 million in commuter rail fares on the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and Metro-North Railroad (MNR).

“This is an issue that requires attention. $700 million per year now,” Lieber said. “We can’t put at risk the ability of working class and middle-class New Yorkers to get where they need to go. That is money that could be used to provide more frequent service, more reliable service.”

The panel’s report included more than 70 recommendations to combat fare and toll evasion, which were divided into four categories: education, environment, equity and enforcement.

The report recommended that the agency replace traditional subway turnstiles with modern plexiglass fare gates, prototypes of which were on display in Grand Central Terminal during Wednesday’s press conference.

“Done right, these doors are too high to jump over, too low to duck under, and too strong to push open. Based on conversations with peer systems, the current thinking is that the doors will have to be five feet tall or higher at the top, and no more than six inches off the ground at the bottom. No form of fare gate, of course, is totally immune to evasion – but these gates do promise to be a major improvement for New York,” according to the report.

Other recommendations included: expanding the Fair Fares program, which offers half-priced MetroCards to low-income residents, to cover more New Yorkers; deploying additional ‘Eagle Teams’ to issue summonses for fare evasion; adjusting enforcement practice to issue warning for first-time offenders; and working with the state legislature to bolster laws against license plate obstruction.

“This is not your grandfather’s approach to fare evasion,” said MTA Special Counsel Jeremy Feigelson. “It’s fresh, it’s different, it’s comprehensive. It’s an approach that for the first time says we’re going to pay just as much attention to the driver of the Mercedes with a fake plate as we are to the person who’s walking through the subway exit gate.”

The Beginning of the End of the Turnstile,2023-12-07 13:00:49.270000+00:00,"Photo: Clio Chang

In its Blue-Ribbon Panel report on fare evasion, the MTA described the various means of jumping a standard turnstile with what you could interpret as begrudging respect. “All require a high degree of intention,” reads the report. “Some require athleticism.” Evading the new gates at the Sutphin Boulevard–Archer Avenue station in Queens — swinging doors that stand about four feet high — demand perhaps even more intention, more athleticism. “People still do it,” an MTA worker told me on a calm Wednesday afternoon — while it’s much harder, they still manage to double up or crawl under. The long-armed can even activate the exit sensors with a little bit of stretching. Some even still jump, he said. “I was surprised.”

The Blue-Ribbon report, released in May, recommended the gates as a new tool in the MTA’s battle against fare-beating, but they’re also significantly wider and easier for bikes, strollers, and wheelchairs to move through. In place of the emergency exit, there is also now an even bigger gate. I watched as a commuter named Sylvester Uwadiegwu easily rolled his e-bike through one of the extra-wide turnstiles. He liked the new setup. “If you try to jump it, you might injure yourself,” he said.

The Sutphin gates are a trial balloon in a wider campaign against fare evasion, a pet obsession of the mayor’s. (“If we start saying it’s all right for you to jump the turnstile, we are creating an environment where any and everything goes,” he said last year as the NYPD began a new crackdown, an effort that has mostly criminalized poor New Yorkers of color.) The new gates are built by the same contractor that designed OMNY and were part of a preexisting contract, with installation costing just under $700,000. (Instead of all of this complicated and expensive work, perhaps public transportation could just be free?) Penn Station will be getting its own gates soon enough, and New York City Transit president Rich Davey said that he was hoping to get the formal bidding process started on additional gates “early in the new year.”

As is the case with all new tech, there are design glitches. As I watched people enter and exit with their rolling luggage — the station was chosen because it connects with the AirTrain — one of the gates ended up getting stuck with the doors open. Nobody walked through, but they certainly could. After a few minutes, the station worker positioned himself in front of it, looking a little bewildered. “If ten people go in, you’re not able to do anything.”",https://www.curbed.com/2023/12/mta-fare-gates-evasion-sutphin-boulevard.html
Why the M.T.A. Is Worried About Fare Evaders on Buses,2024-08-27 00:00:00,"Today, almost one million bus riders are likely to slip through the back door of a city bus or rush past the operator without making eye contact, evading the fare. During the first three months of 2024, 48 percent of bus riders did not pay, signaling a crisis for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which needs the fare revenue to help fund the beleaguered transit system.

Turnstile jumpers in the subways and riders who sneak onto buses have created a large financial problem for the M.T.A., the state agency that runs the city transit system. Two years ago, the M.T.A. lost $315 million because of bus fare evasion and $285 million as a result of subway fare beaters, according to a 2023 report commissioned by the authority. Roughly twice the number of people ride the city’s subways as do its buses, and 14 percent of subway riders evade the fare.",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/nyregion/mta-bus-fare-evaders.html
MTA tests pilot program involving subway stations' emergency gates to stop fare evasion,2024-01-30 15:27:00+00:00,"More changes are coming to subway stations across New York City, as special emergency gates are set to go up in an effort to stop fare beating.

Almost anyone who has taken the subway has likely seen someone use the emergency gate to exit the subway platform, then one or more people use the open gate to walk on to the subway platform without paying. Riders skip out on the $2.90 fare happens so frequently, the MTA has said it costs the agency hundreds of millions of dollars.

That's the reasoning behind the new pilot program that will be starting in February.

Three subway stations — the 59th Street station on the 4/5/6 lines in midtown Manhattan, the 138th Street-Third Avenue station on the 6 line in the Bronx, and the Flushing Avenue station on the J/M/Z lines — will have emergency gates that have 15-second delays.

The idea is that if the gate takes longer to open, fewer people will leave through that exit — meaning fare beaters won't be able to walk in.

For wondering why those three stations in particular were selected, it's because they have plenty of turnstiles for people to exit in case of an actual emergency.

There are also new metal barriers which are part of the barrier fin pilot program. They have been installed at the Lexington Avenue/59th Street station so people cant hop over the turnstiles and avoid the toll.

Racial Disparities Found in NYC Fare Evasion Enforcement,2023-02-22 11:30:34-05:00,"Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

Fare evasion enforcement skyrocketed in the last three months of 2022 following a surge of police presence in the subway system, but arrests and summonses continue to be doled out disproportionately to Black and Latino riders.

The NYPD’s fare evasion data shows that police made 601 arrests and handed out 13,157 summonses for fare evasion in the fourth quarter of 2022, after the state, city, and Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced a massive increase of police presence underground, aimed at establishing “omnipresence” and deterring both crime and the perception thereof, following a particularly violent period in 2022 on the rails.

Arrests in the fourth quarter of 2022 were 26% higher than in the third, and 134% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2021. Summonses were 17% above third-quarter numbers and 46% above the fourth quarter of last year.

MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber, who previously touted the increased enforcement, said last year that policing fare evasion can often deter or prevent larger-scale crimes and contributes to a sense of order in the system, often declaring that while not all fare evaders are criminals, “virtually every criminal is a fare evader.”

“That is part of the strategy,” Lieber said at the MTA Board in October. “Once they stop someone for fare evasion, they’re checking warrants, and it’s leading to the recovery of weapons very successfully.”

The increased enforcement stemmed, in part, from the Governor and Mayor’s October announcement that they were funding 1,200 additional police overtime hours daily in the subway system. Furthermore, the MTA hired private contractors to guard fare gates, intended to deter turnstile-jumping.

At the MTA’s NYC Transit Committee meeting on Tuesday, NYCT president Richard Davey said that riders are now feeling safer. He touted customer satisfaction surveys finding 18% of riders felt safer riding the subway than a month prior.

But continuing a longstanding historical pattern, enforcement against fare evasion continues to be heavily concentrated against Black and Latino riders. About 66% of people given fare evasion summonses in the fourth quarter were Black and Latino, according to the NYPD’s data; those groups compose 52.3% of the city’s population, according to US Census data.

Arrests were even more disproportionate: 93% of arrests were made against Black and Latino riders. That high disparity in enforcement is in line with historic trends. For instance, 94% of third-quarter arrestees were Black or Latino, as were 92% of second-quarter arrestees and 88% of those arrested in the first quarter. White people are 40% of New York City’s population but composed just 6% of fare evasion arrests in the fourth quarter.

The station with the highest number of arrests was not Times Square or Union Square, but Broadway Junction in Brooklyn. Eighty-nine percent of the population in ZIP Code 11207, where the station is located, is Black or Latino.

Reached for comment, an MTA spokesperson referred amNewYork Metro to the NYPD; a department spokesperson said that the increase in summonses and arrests could be explained by a 22% increase in “index crimes” overall in 2022, and that fare evasion enforcement levels last year were in-line with pre-pandemic levels. Enforcement is concentrated at “priority stations.”

“We focus officer deployments on priority stations and lines throughout the system,” the spokesperson said. “NYPD officers patrol day and night to keep the millions of daily riders safe and enforce the law fairly and equally without consideration of race or ethnicity.”

Enforcement against fare hopping has long been decried by advocates, with critics highlighting the nonviolent nature of the offense and the meager amount of revenue lost per fare beaten—in addition to the racial disparities in enforcement. Fines for fare evasion run up to $100, even though a subway ride costs just $2.75.

MTA Board member David Jones, also the president of the Community Service Society and a longtime critic of fare evasion policing, said at the NYCT committee on Tuesday he is “worried” about the persisting racial disparities even as transit officials step up enforcement.

“T[ransit Adjudication Bureau] summonses fall almost exclusively on Black and Brown people,” said Jones. “And while I don’t say they shouldn’t be enforced, I want equity in the system. And it hasn’t happened yet, particularly when you see these kinds of numbers.”

Asked about the data, the New York Civil Liberties Union said it was representative of “failed” policing tactics.

“The NYPD’s latest fare evasion data shows alarming racial disparities, with Black and Brown riders grossly overrepresented among persons arrested,” said Michael Sisitzky, NYCLU’s assistant director of policy. “With the Adams administration doubling down on failed, racist, broken windows policing tactics, the NYPD and MTA’s crackdown on fare evasion risks funneling thousands more Black and Brown New Yorkers into the criminal legal system. Arrests won’t solve the MTA’s problems, but they could devastate New Yorkers.”

Throughout 2022, Lieber and other MTA executives pledged the release of a “blue ribbon” report on fare evasion in the system, which he has said costs the cash-strapped authority $500 million annually and makes paying customers feel like “suckers.” In December, Lieber told amNewYork Metro the report’s release would be delayed indefinitely, amid talks with the city’s District Attorneys, several of whom had pledged to cut or eliminate farebeating prosecutions.

Nevertheless, in a presentation at the MTA Board on Tuesday, Demetrius Crichlow — NYCT’s Senior Vice President for the Subways division — included as a 2023 goal “support[ing] Blue Ribbon panel recommendations to reduce fare evasion.”

This story has been updated with comment from the NYPD and NYCLU.

Op-Ed: NYC Bus Fare Evasion Impact on Transit System Revenue,2024-09-01 08:00:47-04:00,"Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

Bus fare evasion might seem like a victimless crime, but it’s not. Two million daily bus customers suffer when riders skip out on paying the fare. Less revenue means less money we can spend on running better service – by hiring more operators and mechanics, modernizing our fleet, and improving frequency and reliability.

That’s why last week New York City Transit started increasing the number unarmed fare inspectors, called EAGLE teams, on board buses and at bus stops throughout the City. In the first few days of increased enforcement, they handed out tens of thousands of flyers about paying the fare and issued summonses on dozens of bus routes across the five boroughs. The new deployment is strategically focused on changing the culture of fare evasion, both when inspectors are present and not.

This was a necessary intervention. Fare evasion on buses cost the MTA $312 million in 2022, and the problem’s only gotten worse since then. As of this year, roughly 50% of riders are not paying to board, up from 21% in 2020 – and we know it’s not because they all don’t have the money. There are well-heeled New Yorkers evading a $2.90 fare just because they think they can. They will need to think again.

It’s not right and it’s deeply demoralizing to everyone who plays by the rules. New York is all about shared public spaces, and we don’t want the most important ones, like those in the transit system, to feel disorderly or lawless. Nor do we want them to feel unwelcoming or overly punitive, which is why we’re following the recommendations of the MTA’s Blue-Ribbon Panel on Fare and Toll Evasion and prioritizing equity and education alongside enforcement.

Our Reduced Fare MetroCard program offers half-priced fares for riders over 65 and those with qualifying disabilities, while the City of New York’s Fair Fares initiative provides the same benefit to low-income residents. Public school students can save by using brand-new Student OMNY Cards to get four free rides a day all year long with no time restrictions.

And of course, everyone can take advantage of the weekly fare cap, which gives riders all the benefits of a 7-Day Unlimited MetroCard without paying in advance when they use the same contactless card or device for every trip.

Bottom line: a fare is required to ride. We want folks to keep taking the bus, but we won’t be able to run the frequent and efficient service New Yorkers deserve unless everyone pays their fair share. Your paying to ride along with fellow New Yorkers keeps us all moving together.

NEW YORK (WABC) -- The MTA announced a specialized team of officers will now work to enforce the payment of bus fares.

The teams will be on the buses and at bus stops, the MTA said.

According to the MTA, it lost $315 million to bus fare evasion last year. That $315 million is from buses alone -- which have suddenly become the MTA's biggest source of fare evasion.

""We estimate 30 to 35% of our bus customers are getting off free every day; which means 66% of New Yorkers who are paying their fare are getting a raw deal,"" said NYC Transit President Rich Davey.

The MTA's beefed up EAGLE teams have arrived to enforce the fares and keep a watchful eye on the community. EAGLE stands for Evasion and Graffiti Lawlessness Eradication.

These MTA officers are uniformed and unarmed. The teams are also supported by the NYPD.

The NYPD's support is important because the Transit Union says fare-jumpers have been likely to engage in other criminal acts.

""Our main issue is the onslaught of assaults our members face every single day,"" Safety Director of TWU Local 100 John Chiarello said. ""We know that far evasion and assaults go hand in hand.""

With ridership way back up and the MTA reporting solid financial numbers, they say they want to get a handle on this immediately.

""That is money we should be using to provide better transit, and instead it's totally lost,"" MTA Chairman Janno Lieber said. ""It's not fair to the millions of riders who play by the rules, who every day swipe their credit card.""

Another point the MTA is stressing is that it does not want the crime of fare evasion to be a crime of poverty.

Low-income New Yorkers are eligible for half-off fare cards.

The MTA is working with the Department of Social Services to keep ridership up and fair for everyone.

MTA deploys crew of enforcers to stomp out fare-beating as nearly half of NYC bus riders don’t pay,2024-08-26 00:00:00,"Fare evasion is so rampant on city buses that almost half of all riders aren’t paying — as scrambling transit officials deploy a new crew of enforcers to catch the freeloaders.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s unarmed “fare inspectors” will be stationed in buses and at bus stops after fare evasion skyrocketed from 21% in 2020 to roughly 50% in the first quarter of 2024 — costing estimated millions in lost revenue every year.

“The MTA uses your fares to hire more bus operators and mechanics, expand and modernize our fleet, and improve frequency and reliability,” the MTA said in a statement. “When you pay your fares, you are helping us deliver better service to the over 2 million New Yorkers who rely on buses every single day.”

Bus-hopping has cost the transit system $312 million in 2022 alone, according to the agency — sapping a pool of money that helps fund about a quarter of the system’s budget.

MTA bus driver Curtis Carrington, 43, who has been driving for nine years, told The Post that fare-beating was so common, it was comical — and scoffed at the idea that drivers should be the ones responsible for enforcement.

His job, he said, starts and finishes with getting passengers safely from point A to point B — nothing more, nothing less.

“I see it all the time — every day,” Carrington said. “Out of a busload of people — let’s say 10 people got on, maybe two paid.

“I just look the other way — we’re taught not to fight the fare,” Carrington added. “We’ve got people that have gotten assaulted and stabbed because of them fighting the fare.”

Whether the inspectors can do better in fighting fare evasion remains to be seen. Inspectors can ask fare jumpers to get off a bus or can issue a ticket between $50 and $100, according to the MTA.

The inspectors were “soft-launched” last year, but expanded funding will allow for up to 100 inspectors in the 2024 fiscal year, with the staff to be supported by NYPD officers.

The latest rollout comes during an ongoing initiative to get fare payments back up to pre-pandemic levels — including fare enforcement on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North, as well as gate guards at subway stations.

One MTA ticket booth attendant in Brooklyn has even taken it upon himself to announce brazen scofflaws over the loudspeaker in order to get the attention of cops patrolling the station.

While bus drivers have historically shouldered the burden of fare enforcement, the tides shifted due to a policy that emerged in 2008 after a Brooklyn bus driver was stabbed by a fare evader, Gothamist reported.

Protected cockpits for bus drivers were unveiled in 2023, according to the union representing MTA bus drivers, and aimed to protect drivers from “unhinged riders” who could “reach around partitions to strike or throw objects,” the union said last year.

But the barriers didn’t solve all issues on the bus. Last year, an MTA inspector was shot during a dispute over a bus ticket.

Bulletproof protective cockpits should be prioritized by the MTA to protect their drivers, Carrington told The Post.

“I think it’s a priority, honestly, for our safety,” he said.

Fellow MTA bus driver Arlanda Jones agreed.

“We don’t even know where they’re coming from. They could have a razor,” said Jones, 42. “They could have a knife.

“People have been calling me a bitch all the time. And I didn’t even do anything. I don’t [deserve it] — but I still get them to where they got to go safely. That’s my job. So I swallow that,” she added.

The expanded rollout this year comes as 46.9% of local bus riders and 56.6% of SBS bus riders dodged payments in the first quarter of 2024.

That’s compared to subway fare evasion rates at 14% during the same period.

The maddening impossibility of prosecuting $300M a year MTA fare dodgers,2024-08-12 00:00:00,"Nearly half of New York City’s 2 million bus riders evaded paying fares over the last three months, a pattern that helps explain why the MTA reportedly hemorrhaged over $300 million due to bus freeloaders in the last year.

Law-abiding New Yorkers will pay for this type of revenue loss in the form of fare hikes and tax increases.

But just deploying more NYPD officers and fare enforcement agents to combat fare evasion — as the transit authority announced last month it will do — won’t fix the problem.

Until Albany amends the 2020 “discovery law,” the actual consequences for farebeating won’t be enough to convince delinquents to cough up the $2.90 per ride.

In the state of New York, prosecuting “minor” crimes, like fare evasion, has become impossible under discovery reform, which advantages offenders often insurmountably.

Importantly, this is separate from the explicit policies for declining to prosecute fare evasion that district attorneys in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx have adopted since 2017.

The discovery law does not restrict the robust prosecution of farebeating. Instead, it imposes a compliance burden so great that prosecutors are simply unable to consistently prosecute such cases — even when they want to.

A perfect example is the case of Zayan Shar, who was charged last November in Staten Island with “Theft of Services,” a Class A misdemeanor, after dodging bus fare.

Prosecutors filed all the exhaustive material which discovery law now requires as evidence: body-worn camera recordings, a bus-fare evasion data sheet, a bus-fare evasion supporting deposition, video surveillance from the bus, a memo-book entry made by MTA Special Inspector Thomas Femia, who witnessed Shar’s farebeating — and more.

But Shar’s defense attorney was able to get his case dismissed by exploiting the bottomless stringency of the 2020 discovery statute, in combination with New York’s “speedy trial” law, which mandates prosecutors be ready for trial in a set number of days.

Shar’s attorney dilly-dallied for two weeks before raising an issue, all while the window for prosecution narrowed.

Then she claimed prosecutors had failed to “disclose the name of and adequate contact information” for two additional MTA employees who were seen momentarily on video surveillance and bodycam recordings.

The attorney also demanded the memo book and camera audit logs for one of these officers, Special Inspector Christopher Piegari.

Over the following weeks, prosecutors diligently tracked down and shared all these materials.

But defense counsel was nonetheless able to insist prosecutors took too long to collect these — meaningless — extra snips of information.

How meaningless? Piegari neither witnessed Shar’s alleged fare evasion nor informed the NYPD about it. He was, in fact, “only in the presence of the defendant for mere seconds.”

Prosecutors reasoned that none of this new information was “discoverable” — material that constitutes required evidence — because they didn’t intend to call Piegari as a witness. And further, Piegari’s memo book contained “no information regarding the alleged incident.”

But still, the case was tossed.

Shar’s freebie is not a one-off fluke: The Staten Island DA’s Office had around 300 “speedy trial” dismissals in just the first 11 months of last year — 5% of its total caseload.

Compare this to the pre-discovery reform era, when the office dismissed basically zero cases due to “speedy trial” petitions.

Beyond just “speedy trial” dismissals, the discovery burden has pushed the increase of all case dismissals in Staten Island — from less than a quarter of cases in 2019, to almost half of cases in 2023.

And for misdemeanors, like Shar’s stolen bus ride, there were over a thousand more dismissals in the borough last year than in 2019, pre-discovery reform.

And that’s just one borough.

Citywide, “speedy trial” dismissals rose from under 5% of cases in 2019 to over 22% last year.

That’s an astounding increase of 23,564 cases that, like Shar’s, were dismissed because prosecutors couldn’t scramble together every conceivable scrap of “evidence” that defense attorneys could concoct before the permissible time window for prosecution closed.

This absurdity will continue until discovery reform is amended to only require the collection of relevant material, or to decouple discovery collection from the “speedy trial” timeframe.

Yes, greater police presence on buses and more proactive enforcement are important for encouraging the 25% of bus riders who stopped paying fares after 2019 to start doing it again. But it won’t return evasion levels to their 2019 rates.

Until robust prosecution for misdemeanor arrests is an option for district attorneys’ offices, police will also be understandably less motivated to attempt any enforcement beyond a toothless civil summons.

And half the city’s bus straphangers, undeterred by the fear of prosecution, will continue to mooch off the chumps who pay to ride.

Fare evasion cost MTA $690 million in 2022 says report that suggests replacing turnstiles with new technology,2023-05-17 00:00:00,"Fare evasion cost the MTA $690 million last year, according to a new agency study that recommends upping enforcement, expanding low-income fare subsidies, and replacing the subway system’s turnstiles with more modern fare control devices. A fare beater goes over turnstiles.

“Fare and toll evasion … have reached crisis levels, costing hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue, threatening the entire public transit system and tearing at the social fabric of the city and the region,” said the study by a panel of 16 “distinguished New Yorkers,” chosen last year by the MTA.

The figure outpaces last year’s estimated $500 million loss to fare-skipping. The $690 million lost to the system in 2022 is more than 10 times the $65 million the MTA allocated to boost off-peak service on a dozen subway lines citywide.

Bus, train and subway fares as well as vehicle tolls are a significant portion of the MTA’s budget — expected to bring in some $7 billion to the transit system this year, roughly 37% of the total cost of MTA operations.

The biggest monetary loss to fare evasion comes from buses, where a third of riders failed to pay the fare, costing the MTA an estimated $315 million.

On the subways, riders failed to pay an average of 400,000 times a day, costing $285 million last year, and commuter rail fare evasion came to about $44 million.

Drivers with obscured or counterfeit licenses plates account for $46 million in lost revenue from the MTA’s bridges and tunnels, the report says.

That figure does not include some $29.5 million in unpaid by-mail tolls for drivers without E-ZPass.

Janno Lieber, MTA CEO.

On subways, half of all fare evaders sneak in through the emergency exit gates. The other half jump or duck the turnstiles, or follow closely behind another rider on their swipe.

To fix the problem, the panel recommends the MTA replace turnstiles with a plexiglass door system.

“Modernizing fare arrays — turnstiles, exit gates and other physical barriers — is the single most important thing the MTA can do to reduce fare evasion in the subway,” the panel wrote.

A prototype fare gate on display at Grand Central Terminal ahead of an expected Wednesday press conference. An MTA panel on fare evasion recommended replacing the subway’s ubiquitous turnstiles with door-based fare gates to discourage turnstile jumping.

Properly built, the doors will be tall enough to thwart turnstile jumpers and duckers, but wide enough to allow those in wheelchairs or with strollers to get through.

“Provided that the fire code authorities approve of the actual future design, this type of fare array should allow for the complete abolition of the emergency exit gates,” the report says.

On buses, the panel called for more of the MTA’s “Eagle” teams of unarmed fare enforcers, and a redoubled effort to sign up New Yorkers for fare discount programs.

Noting that fare evasion spikes around school dismissal, the panel also recommended for a simplified student OMNY card to replace the various student MetroCard options.

The report calls for increased enforcement, but in a way that reserves criminal charges for serial fare-skippers or those who enable others to skip the fare — such as vandalizing MetroCard or OMNY machines, selling swipes or holding open exit gates.

“Criminal prosecution generally should be reserved for situations that go beyond random individual acts of evasion,” the panelists said.

The MTA should institute policies to “create customers, not criminals,” the authors wrote, calling fare evasion “a problem so big that enforcement alone cannot solve it.”

“What really rose to the top was not criminalizing poverty,” Lisa Daglian, panelist and executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Council to the MTA, told the Daily News.

“Fare evasion is a bigger issue than any of us thought it would be — and so the solution has to be bigger,” she said.

The panel recommends a change in enforcement — an official warning to first-time offenders who are not wanted for or involved in another crime.

On a second offense, the report recommends a $100 summons — $50 of which would be given back to a fare evader in the form of an OMNY card.

“This approach has been taken in the Netherlands, and supports the effort to turn a fare evader into a paying customer,” the report says.

Three-time offenders would get no OMNY card, and would be hit with a $150 fine. Fourth time offenders would face a $200 fine, and serial recidivists would face criminal charges.

The panel also voiced strong support for an expansion of the city’s Fair Fares program to include New Yorkers making twice the federal poverty line or less.

The MTA is plastering quirky ads across its subways and buses as a part of its latest effort to combat fare evasion.

“For every rider who participates in Fair Fares rather than fare evasion, the MTA would receive revenue that is crucially needed to keep the system alive and well for riders of all income levels,” the report reads.

The Fair Fare expansion is currently being debated as part of budget negotiations between Mayor Adams and the City Council.",https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/05/17/fare-evasion-cost-mta-690-million-in-2022-says-report-that-suggests-replacing-turnstiles-with-new-technology/
MTA moves forward on plans to redesign subway turnstile in latest effort to combat fare evasion,2023-12-26 16:00:22-05:00,"Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

The MTA is moving forward with plans to redesign its subway turnstiles, taking the first steps to procure a replacement for fare gates that officials say are too easy to hop over.

The transit agency on Tuesday put out a “request for information” (RFI) from vendors interested in designing a new, modernized turnstile to replace the one long in use at the city’s 472 subway stations. The RFI solicits firms to present ideas for “secure, accessible, and modern fare gates” that “meet the MTA’s goals for ensuring fare compliance and preventing fare evasion, enhancing accessibility, and improving the customer experience.”

Interested firms must present plans for both “wide-aisle” gates that are accessible for wheelchair users, people with strollers, or anyone else needing extra room, as well as standard turnstiles that are still accessible for people with disabilities, while also being harder to jump over than the existing, low-to-the-ground twirlers.

“The safety of all New Yorkers is my top priority,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement. “These new fare gates will improve the safety and accessibility of the Subway system, while ensuring riders have an easier time entering and exiting stations.”

MTA officials say the existing turnstile is “too porous” and easily gamed, either by jumping over, “back-cocking,” or simply strolling through the emergency exit gate that’s often opened by passengers arriving at their destination. Agency bigwigs say fare evasion cost the agency $700 million in 2022, a figure that’s grown significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic and could grow larger still.

A number of international firms have already publicly expressed interest in what is sure to eventually be a lucrative contract for redesigning thousands of turnstiles across the five boroughs.

In May, the MTA opened up Grand Central Terminal to showcase firms’ vision for the turnstile of the future, with demonstrations from U.S.-based Conduent, Germany’s Scheidt & Bachmann, and French firms Easier and Thales. All of their proposals were relatively similar, featuring a fare gate that opens middle-out and is far more difficult to scale than the current clockwise twirler.

The subway system remains years away from a full-scale turnstile redesign, but fare evasion is a contemporary problem. So in the meantime, the MTA’s answer has been to significantly step up police enforcement. Fare evasion arrests and summonses have skyrocketed this year, with more than 90% of enforcement against Black and Latino riders. Summonses in general have also gone up.

Gothamist reported that overtime expenditures for policing in the subway has increased this year to $155 million, up from just $4 million last year. Late in 2022, the city and state announced funding for 1,200 additional overtime hours every day for cops in the subway system after a series of high-profile crimes underground.

But the issue on the subway pales in comparison to the bus, where MTA officials estimate more than a third of riders do not pay the fare. The answer to the question on buses is not as cut-and-dry as on the subway, though; the MTA has expanded its “Eagle Teams” of inspectors who board buses to check that fares have been paid. Formerly the sole domain of Select Buses, Eagle Teams have been expanded to local routes as well as bus stop “hubs” where many lines converge.",https://www.amny.com/transit/mta-redesign-subway-turnstile-fare-evasion/

MTA battles flaws with new turnstiles amid rise in fare evasion,2024-01-26 00:00:00,"Social media influencer Kiing Spiider’s videos are mostly staged scenes of him using his parkour and free-running skills to save people in the subway from pretend danger, but after Jan. 4th, he was no hero to the MTA.

Spiider posted a video showing how to lean over and trigger the sensor of the new fare gates at the Sutphin-Archer subway station to open them without paying. The video now has more than 1 million views on TikTok. Spiider said the video was spurred by his curiosity about how the gates were opening for people exiting.

“I started to look around on the opposite side to see how it was even possible and I noticed there was a sensor on the turnstile,” he said. “But there’s nothing blocking you from touching the sensor if you’re on the other side.”

What You Need To Know One social media influencer found three ways to get around the new turnstiles, with one going viral



The MTA put up two barriers to prevent others from replicating the hack



The barriers are part of a multi-pronged approach to stemming fare evasion, including armed guards, preventing back-cocking turnstiles and delaying exit gates from opening

He posted a subsequent video, showing yet another hack that opens the gate even without even having to reach over very far — or at all.

“The doors are not 100% sturdy, so you can just apply a little bit of pressure onto them and they will open up,” Spiider said.

The gates are part of a pilot program at four stations and one aspect of a multi-pronged approach to stop subway fare evasion. Other parts of the MTA’s plan include preventing back-cocking turnstiles at more than 40 stations, staffing over 400 unarmed guards and changing locks on all the emergency gates due to black market sale of a universal key.

Sutphin-Archer is the only station, however, where the new gates replaced a whole set of turnstiles.

“It’s got problems. We are actually already addressing those problems step-by-step,” said MTA chair and CEO Janno Lieber. “There’s already some barriers so people don’t mess with trying to make the thing open illegally.”

The barriers only consist of two parallel plexiglass sheets at only one set of the whole array, and police are doing most of the work. Lieber said despite the issues, the new fare gates led to a 20% increase in paid fares just by eliminating the use of the emergency gate.

“We had to experiment with a new turnstile in general and one reason we did it there is, that’s where everybody is getting off the plane, they’re coming from JFK airport,” Lieber said. “They’re trying to get into the subway system and they couldn’t get on because they had bags, so they’d use the emergency gate, which creates a huge fare evasion problem.”

Fare evasion cost the MTA about $700 million in 2022, and the most recent data shows it’s getting worse. About 11% of subway customers were not paying as of the first quarter of last year, that increased to 14% by the third quarter, according to the MTA.

Lieber said the new fare arrays were readily available, but they likely won’t be the final ones. Last month, the MTA put out a request for products for the agency to try. Kiing Spiider said he’d be happy to help test them.

“They should definitely hire me to test the new fare gates,” Spiider said. “I’m a New Yorker, I know the ins-and-outs. I know exactly what we are looking for.”

Meanwhile, the MTA finally got approval from fire officials to put a 15 second delay on the opening of emergency gates to deter people from going through for free. That pilot will start in three stations in the coming weeks.

Lieber said fighting fare evasion is essential, and the MTA needs to cut it by half to maintain their current financial plan.",https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/traffic_and_transit/2024/01/26/mta-battles-flaws-with-new-turnstiles-amid-rise-in-fare-evasion
"NYC transit: MTA rolls out new ways to stop fare evasion at train, subway turnstiles",2024-05-26 22:00:00.297000+00:00,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — The MTA is looking to make things more difficult for fare evaders.

As part of an effort to reduce fare evasion on the subway, the MTA has installed upgrades at more than 100 stations across New York City to make it harder for people to go over (or around) turnstiles.

Recently, the agency announced that 1,400 turnstiles at over 100 train stations have been upgraded to prevent “back-cocking,” a technique where the turnstile is pulled or passed back so a person can slink through.

In addition, the MTA said it installed turnstile “fins” at four pilot stations, meant to deter fare jumpers who prefer the up-and-over method.

“The MTA recognizes fare evasion is an existential challenge,” said MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber. “We understand that this is a complex issue without a one-size-fits-all solution – there are fare evaders who are determined not to pay, those who would have otherwise but see an opportunity, and some who might struggle with affordability fares. These all require their own solutions – in the immediate term that means starting out with enforcing the fare immediately, while making sure people are aware of resources that can help those who are truly in need. It means communicating to riders why it’s so important to pay the fare, and it means changing the physical fare control area in the short-term and rethinking it for the long-term.”

According to the MTA, the new upgraded turnstiles have reduced “back-cocking” at participating stations by 80%. The fins have also lead to a 20% decrease in evasion at the four pilot stations.

The MTA plans to install these new modifications in 60% of all turnstiles citywide by the end of 2024.

New budget forbids MTA from using facial recognition to bust fare evaders,2024-05-04 00:00:00,"The Metropolitan Transit Authority has been barred from using facial recognition software to bust fare evaders, according to a new measure quietly passed in Albany.

The prohibition was slipped unnoticed into the state’s $237 billion budget, which passed last month.

The new law states the MTA must “not use, or arrange for the use, of biometric identifying technology, including but not limited to facial recognition technology, to enforce rules relating to the payment of fares.”

3 Critics argue facial recognition technology “could invade upon people’s lives.” Christopher Sadowski

Like many tweaks, the measure was shoehorned into the budget without public debate or comment.

State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani of Queens told told Gothamist that facial recognition technology was a concern because it “could invade upon people’s lives through expanded surveillance and through the criminalization of just existing within the public sphere.”

The Democratic Socialist later insisted to The Post he wasn’t involved with the measure to ban the tech.

The chronically cash-strapped agency lost $700 million to fare theft in 2023, according to the Citizens Budget Commission.

The New York Police Department also does not use facial recognition to assist in finding fare evaders, an police spokesman said.

Albany Republicans expressed outrage at the new rule.

“As New York continuously becomes an unsafe and an unfordable place to live, our state government continues to tie the hands of our law enforcement and not hold people accountable for their actions,” said Brooklyn GOP Assemblyman Michael Tannousis. “The MTA loses $700 million a year in fare evasion and instead of giving the right tools to retain these funds, they are relying on congestion pricing to raise $1 billion from our hardworking middle class.”",https://nypost.com/2024/05/04/us-news/new-budget-forbids-mta-from-using-facial-recognition-to-bust-fare-evaders/
New York Transit Agency Intentionally Slowing Buses to Punish Riders for Fare Evaders,2022-05-23 13:00:00+00:00,"Every New York City bus has at least two doors, one at the front and one in the rear. Longer articulated buses also have a center door, which functions like a second rear door. Passengers board at the front, where they pay the fare. They exit (usually) through the rear door. This is how the bus has worked for decades. And it made some sense in the days of physical fare payment systems like coins, tokens, or by dipping their MetroCard in the machine.

But, today, it’s a flawed system that slows down buses. If more than one person is boarding the bus, a line must form to pay the fare. The rear door goes unused while people wait at the front to get on the bus. It is also a system that encourages people to not pay the fare since it is faster and easier for some people to go through the rear door. And the only fare enforcement mechanism is the bus driver, who isn’t in a position to act as a fare enforcer.

Videos by VICE

Fortunately, there is a solution to this, enabled by modern ways to pay fares like tap-to-pay systems: Install payment readers at all doors or somewhere else on the bus, like they do in many other countries. Should fare evasion be a concern to the powers that be, employ fare checkers to spot-check riders. If fare evasion is as big of a problem as the transit agency thinks it is, the fare-checkers will at the very least pay for themselves. It’s the way fare payment works on transit systems around the world.

But New York City’s transit system, run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, is doing a peculiar thing. It took the time and money to do the hardest and most expensive part of this improved system, mainly installing payment readers at all doors of every bus in the system. But it is refusing to turn on the ones at the rear doors. “FRONT DOOR ONLY,” these readers say.

The MTA is doing this because it’s worried about fare evasion. The MTA was supposed to test 10 local routes for all-door boarding but has since backpedaled. The MTA is doing this even though all-door boarding has been proven to reduce fare evasion, and also makes bus trips faster and thus better.

Last week, eight local politicians sent a letter to MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber expressing “concern” that the MTA is still not allowing all-door boarding. “All-door boarding has been shown to be an effective tool to reduce dwell time at bus stops, and must be a strategy we employ to speed up our buses, improve on-time performance, and improve ridership across the board.”

The letter acknowledges—and the MTA does not dispute—that the main reason for this is because of high rates of fare evasion. “We appreciate that the Council Members and Borough President understand our concern with fare evasion on a system where currently one out of three bus riders evades the fare,” MTA spokesperson Michael Cortez said in a statement. “We look forward to working with them on impactful measures that will increase bus speeds including new bus lanes, camera enforcement and route redesign.”

Fare evasion has been an MTA bugaboo on and off for several decades, popping up when the city gets swept up in the latest crime wave or quality-of-life fever or when the MTA needs to deflect attention from its own systemic mismanagement. This is unfortunate because, in this case, the thing the MTA isn’t doing because of fare evasion is actually a proven solution to fare evasion. All-door boarding exists in New York City already, albeit only on the 20 Select Bus Service routes, which have existed with all-door boarding for 15 years. According to the MTA’s own metrics, those Select Bus Service routes have lower fare evasion rates than all other buses, and those rates actually fell over time—to just 2.2 percent in 2018—compared to the rapidly rising fare evasion rates on local buses. It is worth noting that the SBS operates essentially on the honor system, with fare inspectors occasionally checking for proof of payment at certain stops. The MTA’s own 2018 study on fare evasion concluded the supposed spike in fare evasion had nothing to do with rear door boarding. “The majority of the [fare evasion] increase is due to more front door evasion,” it found.

But one doesn’t have to dig into obscure years-old reports buried on the MTA’s website to know this. In a list of “On Background” points sent to Motherboard—a provision Motherboard never agreed to and will therefore be quoting as it is central to the issue this article is highlighting—Cortez acknowledged turning on the rear-door payment readers would help reduce fare evasion. “The fare payment area on buses is currently adjacent only to the front door. Individuals who may enter the rear door when it is opened to allow customers to off-board do not have ready access to a fare payment, which observations have shown makes fare payment less likely.” This is common sense: More people will pay the fare if they can actually, physically pay the fare.

The MTA says it will roll out all-door boarding on all buses when the full OMNY rollout, the agency’s new fare payment system, is completed and accommodate all types of fares and payment options. But there’s no reason to wait. Just look at the subway, where OMNY readers were installed at every turnstile. Anyone who doesn’t want to or can’t use OMNY can still use a MetroCard like they have for decades. Likewise, anyone who still relies on MetroCards can still board at the front of the bus. Or look at the commuter railroads which the MTA also runs. They have been operating on a “proof of payment” system with all-door boarding where ticket checking is sporadic at best.

In fact, the commuter railroads are illustrative of how fare evasion is little more than a societal construct. It is close to impossible to evade the fare on the commuter rail lines in any criminal sense. If the ticket checker comes through and you haven’t bought a ticket, you can simply buy a ticket from them, or pull out your phone and buy a ticket using the mobile app, which the ticket checker will then scan. No such option exists for buses. Of course, New York City’s buses are primarily ridden by people of lower income, people of color, immigrants, and the elderly, while commuter railroads mostly serve middle-to-upper-middle class suburbs.

What the MTA’s nonsensical and self-contradictory anti-all-door-boarding policy amounts to is punishing all bus riders with slower buses for the behavior of a minority. The MTA fully admits it could turn the rear door payment readers on if it wanted, but it is mad at some bus riders, so it won’t.

“We can’t say concretely how enabling all-door boarding would affect the MTA’s interpretations of fare evasion, but we do know that it would make service faster and easier for people who rely on the bus, in addition to improving operator safety,” said Ashley Pryce, Advocacy and Organizing Manager with the New York-based nonprofit TransitCenter. “With OMNY readers now installed on all buses, MTA has the infrastructure in place to make trips more seamless. It’s a waste of money not to use it when the benefit for riders would be so great.”

Will the MTA actually enable all-door boarding when the OMNY rollout is done, likely in 2024? If all-door boarding would supposedly lead to more fare evasion now, why wouldn’t it in two years? In late April, the MTA announced the creation of a Blue Ribbon Panel to study the issue of fare evasion. The MTA’s announcement says the panel will “develop recommendations to reduce fare evasion.” Perhaps it will recommend doing something that has already worked, right here in New York: letting people pay at all the doors.",https://www.vice.com/en/article/new-york-transit-agency-intentionally-slowing-buses-to-punish-riders-for-fare-evaders/
"MTA adds fare checkers to buses, Letters",2024-08-30 00:00:00,"The Issue: MTA adding fare checkers to buses, which are especially vulnerable to fare evasion.

The MTA’s idea of hiring fare inspectors for buses is comical and recalls former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s so-called violence interrupters (“MTA is getting fare-beaten up,” Aug. 27).

I hope these inspectors are given major medical coverage, because they’re going to need it.

Some of the fare-beaters are the same people who will attack you on the subway for looking at them wrong.

Working as a fare inspector sounds like the worst job ever.

Robert Mangi

Garden City

My grandfather was a fare collector in the 1950s on the Detroit Street Railroad.

Each car had two employees, a driver and a fare collector.

Passengers entered via the back door (where the fare collector was located) and exited by the front door.

It seems to me that the MTA is losing revenue to hire a fare collector for every NYC bus.

A better solution would be: Stop the bus and notify police to arrest farebeaters if they refuse to pay.

This would solve the revenue problem.

Dick Vale

Schenectady

Sure, stop the bus riders from boarding through the back door.

Set up turnstiles, so they can’t be jumped.

But most importantly, ensure there is no longer false overtime pay, which is costing the MTA millions.

Bunny Abraham

Manhattan

This year marks the 55th anniversary of when NYC bus drivers stopped giving change for cash fare.

Safety increased for everyone, as previously drivers dealt with potential robbery while in service.

Instead, they spent more time concentrating on driving and less time making change for riders.

Even with the recent price increase, the OMNY card is a great bargain: Riders should pay the fare.

Larry Penner

Great Neck

The idea that revenue from congestion pricing should subsidize the MTA is absurd, when fare evaders are bleeding the system dry.

The Issue: Former President Donald Trump’s controversial visit to Arlington Cemetery this week.

Miranda Devine wrote an excellent synopsis of the Afghanistan withdrawal under the incompetent leadership of President Biden (“Callous Joe’s military horror,” Aug. 29).

A suicide bomber killed 13 American soldiers and injured scores of others.

For Biden to want to blame former President Donald Trump is cowardice.

America, vote for your country, not based on your hatred toward one man.

Chelli Nobile

Regarding Devine’s column about Trump’s wreath-laying ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery for Gold Star families: It’s interesting how soon we all forget Trump’s past comments about veterans.

Trump has reportedly called Americans who died in war “losers and suckers” because there was nothing in it for them.

He allegedly wanted to keep wounded veterans out of his parades because he didn’t like how they looked.

This visit was a show to make him look sympathetic to the public’s eye: Bringing a videographer and photographer to the event was actually prohibited.

Empathy was not the motivator here. Let’s wake up and see the light, people.

MTA to start crackdown on fare evasion in September after reporting $315M in losses,2023-08-03 00:00:00,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will begin its long-awaited fare-beating crackdown next month on city buses — following $315 million in losses last year.

Unarmed fare enforcement agents, typically reserved for select bus service routes, were deployed Thursday to start manning local bus service for the first time. But enforcement starts in September.

Passengers on SBS routes swipe their MetroCards before getting on and are required to show their receipts to the agent. But on a regular-service bus, riders swipe their cards in front of the driver — or, in some cases, they just don’t pay.

Fare evasion on buses accounted for nearly half of the estimated $700 million the MTA lost to non-payment in 2022.

“All of a sudden, buses have become the No. 1 fare evasion problem,” said MTA chairman Janno Lieber. “That is money we should be using to provide better transit, but, instead, it’s totally lost.”

He added: “It’s not fair to the millions of riders who play by the rules.”

The agency said the agents would first focus on routes that hit the Fulton Street Mall, Kips Bay or the Staten Island Ferry Terminal.

The MTA is set to begin its crackdown on fare-beating on city buses in September. Christopher Sadowski

City Transit chief Rich Davey added that the agents will spend much of the next six weeks issuing warnings and passing out information about the Big Apple’s reduced fare options for low-income New Yorkers before they start writing summonses in mid-September.

A report issued by the MTA earlier this year estimated the agency lost $691 million in 2022 alone due to riders skipping out on paying the fare — $315 million of that was attributed to riders walking onto the Big Apple’s buses without swiping their MetroCard or tapping on OMNY.

The agency has also announced plans to tighten the gearing on subway turnstiles to make it harder for fare-beaters to slip through and expects to detail plans for a complete redesign of the system’s entry barriers with new high-tech gates that are harder to jump over.",https://nypost.com/2023/08/03/crackdown-on-nyc-bus-fare-evasion-to-begin-in-september/
Opinion | The Solution to New York’s Transit Problem Is So Obvious Nobody Wants to Hear It,2024-09-05 00:00:00,"Traveling recently on the London Tube and on the city’s double-decker buses, I wondered, as I have many times before, why New York City can’t have a comparable public transit system: safe, clean platforms; turnstiles that function with smart technology; a functioning messaging system and schedules that operate largely on time. Why are such basics unimaginable in New York?

Instead, as New Yorkers know well and international visitors are appalled to discover, we have a system that went from a source of pride to one of embarrassment. There are many reasons for the subway’s woes, from its basic funding structure to exorbitant costs to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s chronic mismanagement, all exacerbated by Gov. Kathy Hochul’s disastrous decision to abandon congestion pricing. Yes, it could and has been worse. I can remember the child’s nightmare of the subway of the 1970s and ’80s. But it’s an especial affront to see the system degrade so profoundly after a period of improvement.

Now, as if to return the city’s insult, many straphangers and bus riders are no longer paying for this diminished privilege. According to The Times, 48 percent of the city’s bus passengers skip paying their fare, among the worst rates of compliance in the world and up from 18 percent in 2018. Nearly a sixth of riders slip onto the subway without paying. Every day, over a million New Yorkers neglect to pay for public transit in New York.

If it’s easy for New Yorkers to locate blame for the system’s problems, it’s harder to admit the reasons behind the public’s malfeasance. The truth is passengers don’t pay because they can get away with it. The harder truth is that the city lets them. And the hardest truth is that the best solution is more policing.",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/opinion/public-transit-subway-bus-police.html

“Laissez Fares:” The MTA’s War on Fare Evasion,2024-08-22 11:00:00+00:00,"As fare evasion has continued to hemorrhage the MTA’s budget, the agency has begun to crack down on its riders.

Become a paid member to listen to this article

When I moved to New York, I thought fare dodging was a rite of passage, an initiation to be a real New Yorker. While clumsy tourists fumble for their MetroCards, fare-dodgers gracefully leap over the turnstiles in stride, sometimes in broad daylight, right in front of an absent-minded MTA worker. For some, fare evasion is a middle finger to the MTA. For others, they simply don’t feel like paying or aren’t able to. The practice of fare evasion isn’t new, but as our public transit systems have evolved, so have evasion and policing tactics.

Regardless of your ethical stance on fare evasion, we can agree it has reached new levels of creativity, ingenuity, and athleticism. Some fare evaders opt to channel their inner Olympic hurdler, catapulting over the gates with a boost from their forearms. Others may limbo under the turnstile—a less dignified approach but it gets the job done. Most will take the path of least resistance, walking through the “emergency gates.” Some might even conspire with a friend by entering through the gates with a fellow rider on their shoulders. The MTA calls this “piggybacking” and it accounts for up to 1% of fare evasion crimes.

Since the pandemic, fare evasion has reached unprecedented levels, which many attribute to the city’s decision to temporarily offer free bus services. This decision backfired when riders became accustomed to free rides. Riders carried this laissez-faire attitude to the subway system, costing the MTA $690 million in lost fares in 2023 alone.

But the MTA wants you to know there is no such thing as a free ride. The agency is trying to bounce back from its $20 billion deficit and is desperate to retrieve lost revenues. To do so, the MTA has begun testing strategies outlined in its Blue Ribbon Report, a comprehensive study that engaged city council members, community activists, and riders on how to combat fare evasion.

The Evolution of Fare Evasion in NYC

New York has been grappling with fare evasion since the inception of public transit. The original method of fare collection on the subway involved “ticket choppers,” guard-operated machines that chopped up paper tickets. This method of collection led to a myriad of problems, from long lines to tickets blowing away in the wind, and riders or subway employees easily passing through without paying.

The first turnstiles, a four-arm wooden model, were introduced to the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT) in the 1920s. An article announcing the installation of these new devices in the Electric Railway Journal notes that the machines leave “no way for a passenger to enter without paying. The human element of employees is entirely eliminated because every coin that is inserted is automatically counted on a recorder. There is no longer the opportunity for either the passengers or employees to practice the abuses formerly common.” Or so they thought at the time…

Electric Railway Journal 1921-11: Vol 58 Iss 22

Riders used nickels to get through the first turnstiles. New models were unveiled at the World’s Fair in 1939-40 and the three-arm models were introduced in the 1950s. Subway tokens were also introduced in the 1950s.

The Transit Museum has a display of “slugs”—also known as “washers”—fake coins used as counterfeit subway tokens. Slugs became so mainstream that they ascended to the zeitgeist of the 1990s, featured in the “Baby Shower” episode of Seinfeld. In the show, Kramer suggests Jerry hire a Russian immigrant who sells “slugs” to help him steal cable television. Subway token black markets emerged, forcing the MTA to keep redesigning the subway token, abandoning its signature “Y token” for more sophisticated designs.

“Token Sucking” was a common practice in the 1980s. This involved stuffing turnstiles with paper or cardboard to purposely jam the machine. After riders inserted their tokens but failed to gain access through the turnstile, they would wander off to report the malfunction to an MTA worker. At that moment, a vigilante would appear. In violation of probably every CDC guideline in the book, the perpetrator would do their best impression of Kirby from Super Smash Bros. and inhale the token from the machine. Token sucking became so prevalent that officers resorted to spraying turnstile slots with mace.

Today’s turnstile dates back to 1994. MetroCards were introduced that year, using technology to communicate with the station terminal and a computer in the booth. You may have spotted the latest advancement in turnstile—“Fare Gates”—at ten stations across the city including the 125th Street station in Harlem and the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Designed to curb turnstile hopping, the gates are a product of the MTA’s “fare evasion lab.” Instead of a turnstile mechanism, these fare gates have doors that are more difficult to climb over.

The “Psychology” of the Fare Evader

The MTA has hired a “behaviorist” to study the psychology of the fare evader, conceding that evasion is not just a crime of opportunity but “an existential challenge.” But this expert didn’t find anything that wasn’t obvious to the everyday commuter.

The Blue Ribbon report breaks evaders into five archetypes: the opportunistic evader, the frustrated evader, the economically stressed evader, the student evader, and the determined evader. The MTA suggested tailoring its response strategies depending on the assailant. For the opportunistic evader, the MTA will hire security guards to man the emergency gates; for the economically stressed evader, the MTA suggested increasing the income threshold to qualify for the “fare fair” subsidy requirement which gives low-income riders a 50% discount. The subsidy is not actually distributed by the MTA but by the Human Resources Administration, a city-operated agency. The HRA’s new program—which increases the income threshold to 140% of the national poverty level—still falls short of the 200% benchmark that transit activists have been pursuing for the last decade.

Fare evasion has become more mainstream, moving beyond the shady underworld it used to inhabit. Subway fares have increasingly become more expensive over the years. Even when accounting for inflation, today’s subway fare is still nearly twice as expensive as it was throughout the twentieth century. While incremental changes from $2.75 to $2.90 don’t seem like much, it can be a major blow for low-income riders. The fare evasion epidemic is a direct consequence of this “subway-flation.”

New Methods of Fare Policing

The MTA’s surveillance has not gone full 1984, assigning social credit scores to passengers who misbehave. But the Adams’ administration has made a concerted effort to beef up its police presence on public transit by increasing spending on police in subway terminals from $4 million to $155 million in 2023. While this initiative was not entirely devoted to fare evasion, it’s not a coincidence that its launch immediately followed the Blue Ribbon Report.

This enforcement has required more manpower than the NYPD can spare. The Adams administration has hired private security teams to monitor petty crimes like fare evasion. The MTA’s “Eagle Teams,” teams of private officers who sweep MTA buses to verify each passenger’s proof of payment, are a product of the Blue Ribbon Panel Report. These teams have been scattered across the five boroughs, targeting the city’s bus lines, where nearly half of passengers don’t pay to ride.

Eagle Teams Ticketing Passenger: Marc A. Hermann / MTA

I had the pleasure of running into one of these teams on my daily commute, riding the M60 between the Upper West Side and Harlem. The team boarded the bus like a DEA sting operation, issuing summonses and accosting passengers. Along with some of my fellow riders, I was slapped with a $100 ticket and instructed to disembark the bus and wait for the next one. I decided to take a miserable walk of shame instead, contemplating the MTA’s sad state of affairs.

Our founder Michelle Young had a similar experience: “I was also stopped on the M60 bus to LaGuardia Airport. I had my ticket for the SBS but I couldn’t find it. I opened my suitcase on the sidewalk to search for it, which was mortifying. However, I found it in the end!”

New York has the slowest bus system in America, a fact I learned while speaking with Danny Pearlstein, President of the Riders Alliance, an organization of transit activists who consulted on the city’s Blue Ribbon Report. Pearlstein is currently promoting the Better Bus Initiative, a fight that is especially timely as the city will discontinue its free bus pilot program later this year. The pilot offered one free bus line in each borough.

Pearlstein argues that the MTA’s “precision policing” is simply an offshoot of “broken windows,” a policy that unfairly targets Black and Brown riders for petty offenses. The NYPD released a public dataset on all of the fare evasion tickets and summonses it has distributed. The Community Service Society sifted through this data, exposing the MTA’s false narrative that monitoring fare evasion can curb violent crime rates. Their spatial analysis revealed that the NYPD was disproportionately targeting the outer boroughs and three times more likely to issue a fare evasion ticket in a Black neighborhood with a 25% poverty level than in a white neighborhood below this threshold. The most ticketed subway stations, with respect to foot traffic, were Beach 44th, Beach 60th, and Beach 90th, all off the A train in the Rockaways. In reverting to the “broken windows” rhetoric of the Giuliani era, the MTA seems to be stuck in the “token-sucking” days of the 1990s.

Moving Beyond Band-Aid Solutions

The Blue Ribbon Report seemed to come to the same conclusion as most New Yorkers: fare evaders are not conniving freeloaders. However, transit activists argue that the report ignores the agency’s complicity in the fare evasion epidemic. As the MTA rolls back its free bus initiative—and ramps up its policing of subway terminals—it’s unclear whether the report’s conclusions will be substantiated by action.

If the MTA wants to permanently seal the annual hole in its budget that fare evasion induces, it needs to address the obvious culprit: the lack of affordability. Bringing the minimum threshold to qualify for the “fair fare” program to 200% of the poverty level is a start. But it only gets New York on a level playing field with its contemporaries, like Chicago and San Francisco.

Cities like Boston have implemented permanent free bus initiatives, which have not only made transit more equitable but also alleviated strains on its metro system. More importantly, it has eased the burden on low-income riders, saving bus riders in the Boston area from $6 million in fare expenses.

Underground NYC Subway Tour BOOK NOW

The Adams’ administration has cited several high-profile crimes to justify deploying more officers in subway terminals. But fare evaders are the ones really paying the price of that surveillance. Until public transit is discussed as a basic human right, fare evasion will continue to be the scapegoat for the MTA’s financial woes. Rather than conflating fare evasion with violent crime, fare evasion should be approached as a crisis of affordability, just like housing instability and food insecurity.

"As nearly half of NYC bus riders don’t pay, MTA deploys inspectors to combat fare evasion",2024-08-28 17:32:17+00:00,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is ramping up its efforts to stop fare evasion in the bus system following a report that nearly half of all riders are not paying. The MTA on Monday revealed that new unarmed fare inspectors will be deployed on local buses throughout the city to enforce fare payment, with fare evaders being asked to leave the bus and potentially facing a summons or arrest. The city bus system has the worst fare evasion problem of any major city in the world, costing the transit agency more than $300 million every year.

New York City’s fare evasion problem has intensified since the pandemic. In 2022, the MTA lost $315 million in revenue from bus fare evasion and $285 million as a result of subway fare evasion, according to a 2023 MTA report.

The rate of fare evasion was at roughly 18 percent in 2018, according to the New York Times.

Under the initiative, inspectors will monitor passengers who skip the fare and escort them off at bus stops staffed by NYPD officers. These officers may issue a summons ranging from $50 to $100, or in certain cases, arrest them, as reported by Gothamist.

NYPD officers will join the fare inspectors, who are part of the MTA’s “EAGLE” fare enforcement unit, on bus routes identified as particularly prone to fare evasion.

This effort builds on a similar crackdown last year, which saw EAGLE members on local bus routes and NYPD officers stationed at 20 stops across the city. Despite these measures, bus fare evasion grew from about 35 percent in 2023 to 47 percent earlier this year.

The Transport Workers Union Local 11 said MTA bus drivers are not encouraged to enforce fares due to concerns over harassment, assault, or worse—a policy influenced partly by the fatal stabbing of a bus driver in 2008 who told a passenger to pay the fare. In April 2023, a bus driver was grazed by a bullet fired by a man who was removed from the bus after refusing to pay the fare, according to Gothamist.

Stopping fare evasion is crucial for the MTA, which is still struggling to secure funding for numerous transit projects that were originally set to be funded by congestion pricing before Gov. Kathy Hochul paused the program.

The new crackdown will continue until the MTA sees evidence that more riders are paying the fare. The NYPD will reassign officers to staff the new initiative, an NYPD spokesperson told Gothamist.

During his tenure, Mayor Eric Adams has spearheaded a system-wide crackdown on fare evasion, focusing primarily on the subway system, despite the majority occurring on buses. According to Gothamist, fare evasion arrests in the subways increased by approximately 250 percent between 2022 and 2023, while police issued 160 percent more evasion tickets.

Commuters outraged over proposed MTA fare and toll hikes,2023-06-27 00:00:00,"Concerned commuters gathered at MTA Headquarters in Manhattan on Monday night to speak their minds at the final MTA public hearing on proposed fare and toll hikes.

“A price hike now is going to affect other students and the millions of New Yorkers who take the train every day,” college student Sabil Manai said.

What You Need To Know The MTA proposes fare hikes every other year, but they were on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic



People testifying on Monday say now is not the time to bring fare hikes back



Under the MTA's proposal, the cost of a subway ride would go up 15 cents to $2.90 Next month, the MTA board will vote on whether or not to approve the rate hikes

Manai lives in Bay Ridge and says she relies on trains to attend college at New York City College of Technology.

“As a student, it will be difficult [when] combined with the financial challenges of college,” Manai said.

Under the MTA's proposal, the cost of a subway ride would go up 15 cents to $2.90.

A seven-day unlimited pass would go up $1.

A 30-day unlimited pass would increase by $5.

A single express bus ride would rise to $7.

And a seven-day unlimited express bus pass would go up $2.

The MTA proposes fare hikes every other year, but they were on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. People testifying on Monday say now is not the time to bring them back.

“[The] majority of New Yorkers who rely on public transportation, such as myself, are struggling in all aspects of life,” student Betsey Lindor from Pelham Bay said.

The MTA is also proposing E-ZPass toll hikes, which would apply to all MTA bridges and tunnels.

The MTA says customers are actually getting a bit of a break. But Lindor disagrees, saying New Yorkers are going to bear the brunt of the proposed fare hikes.

“Raising the fares to me means more financial stress,” Lindor said.

Manai, a student getting her degree in applied chemistry, says the fare increases could sabotage her dreams.

“My livelihood depends on the train,” Manai said.

Other concerns from riders include intermittent service and fare evasion, and how both of those things play into the fare hikes.

MTA: No additional fare hikes expected for now,2024-07-31 00:00:00,"No additional fare hikes, service cuts or job cuts are being considered at this point by the MTA despite a significant expected budget deficit in a couple of years, MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said at the agency’s monthly board meeting Wednesday.

The MTA’s operating budget, used to service debt and pay workers among other expenses, is expected to take a hit of $400 million by 2027 and 2028.

The MTA’s operating budget, used to service debt and pay workers, is expected to take a hit of $400 million by 2027 and 2028



Lower-than-projected real estate tax receipts and fare evasion are currently being blamed for the future deficits to the operating budget

Lower-than-projected real estate tax receipts and fare evasion are currently being blamed for the future deficits to the operating budget.

Although congestion pricing funding wasn’t assumed as part of that plan, the MTA did admit the $15 billion in funding lost when Gov. Kathy Hochul put congestion pricing on pause could be felt by next year.

“The risk that congestion pricing will not be unpaused or that funding not be addressed is a huge risk to our operating budget as well as our capital program,” Lieber said.

More money could need to be spent on emergency overtime to fix old equipment, with MTA employees who work on capital projects shifted to other jobs. There’s also the loss of what was projected to be 1.25% increase in ridership from people switching to mass transit due to congestion pricing.

In all, it could add up to an estimated $340 million a year in losses.

Additionally, if the MTA needs to borrow more money in the future, that debt would be paid for from the operating budget.

“Extra debt service burdens the operating budget, and it forces the board — that will force the board again to deal with the grim options: layoffs, service cuts, fare hikes,” Lieber said. “I think when the last capital program was under discussion, the then-governor said congestion pricing was the alternative to a 30% fare hike.”

The MTA’s next fare hike is set to start in 2025, increasing 4% from the current $2.90 to approximately $3, according to the MTA.

Despite officials saying that effects from the congestion pricing pause wouldn’t be felt until next year, some have argued that those effects are already being felt. On Sunday, the MTA announced it was nixing additional express bus service from Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, citing that the routes were operating with the assumption congestion pricing would move forward. Lieber said the express service was no longer needed since congestion pricing is not currently going forward.

Bus service cuts are also at the center of a lawsuit brought by the Transport Workers Union and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams.

The MTA did admit to being conservative with its fiscal numbers and claimed to have new ways to fight fare evasion that will help with their deficit.

Last year, Hochul said she had saved the MTA from a fiscal cliff with five years of balanced budgets but that has now dropped to four years. Hochul vowed to fill the funding void left when she shelved congestion pricing.",https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/traffic_and_transit/2024/07/31/mta-no-fare-hikes-cuts-despite-budget-deficit
MTA defends fare gate pilot program in subway stations despite ‘piggybackers',2024-01-03 19:05:48+00:00,"The idea behind the new fare gates was to give subway riders easier access to the stations.

But not this easy.

“We are learning. And I’m learning with our customers,” said Quemuel Arroyo, the MTA’s chief accessibility officer, and a senior advisor to the MTA chairman.

He acknowledged an unintended drawback of the new high-tech sensor gates — now in use at four MTA transit hubs — is that many riders have figured out how to avoid paying. By cramming into the space behind the person in front of you, also known as ‘piggybacking,’ multiple people could get through on one fare. News4 saw plenty of that practice during the day at Sutphin Boulevard/Jamaica Station.

“That very observation that you’re alluding to,” said Arroyo, “we will be preventing all those bad actions that we saw!”

Arroyo is the quarterback of the new $700,000 pilot program — with high-tech entry gates at Sutphin Blvd-JFK in Queens, Atlantic Avenue/Barclays Center in Brooklyn, Penn Station in Manhattan and Astoria Boulevard in Queens. Why those stations? They’re all connections to major transit hubs. And, since many riders are bringing big suitcases with them, the new fare gates are wider making it easy for people with luggage to get through. And despite the sight of farebeating, the MTA says so far, the gates have performed well.

“We have increased paid ridership at this station by 20%,” said Arroyo, speaking of the Sutphin gates — frequented by arriving JFK passengers. In the past many with baggage have lingered by the emergency gate, waited for it to open — and then darted in for free when it does. Now, many more of them are paying.

As for the piggybacking problem?

“I wanted to see how customers would utilize those gates. Good and bad,” said Arroyo.

This pilot came months after a special panel found the MTA lost $500M to fare evaders in 2021 and $690M in 2022. A 38% increase.

The panel’s main finding? “The fiscal losses caused by fare and toll evasion are staggering.“

Arroyo said to truly make a dent in farebeating, they need fare gates that aren’t yet available on the market. After all, the MTA has 473 subway stations. And they’ve committed $25 million to re-make the way the riding public gains access to the system. Right now there’s an RFI — a Request for Information — on best practices to solve the problem.

“We will design the gate for New York that combats fare evasion,” Arroyo said.

We must do something about pervasive fare evasion,2024-05-26 10:00:36-04:00,"Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

It’s no secret that I view fare and toll evasion as an existential threat not only to the MTA, but also the long-term future of New York City and the region. One year after the release of a far-reaching report by the Blue-Ribbon panel on Fare Evasion, we’re starting to make progress addressing this complex, $700+-million-a-year issue.

We’ve known from the beginning that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. There are fare evaders who are determined not to pay, those who would have paid but saw an opportunity to grab a freebie, and of course, others who might not have the means to pay. All require different approaches, and that’s what we’ve been experimenting with over the last 12 months.

Criminalization is not the priority. We want customers, not convicts. Instead, the strategy developed by the Blue-Ribbon panel responds to root causes of fare and toll evasion with the four “Es” of Education, Equity, Environment, and Enforcement.

To address the first two Es, MTA has opened 15 Customer Service Centers systemwide where New Yorkers can learn about and enroll in the City’s Fair Fares program, which provides eligible low-income applicants with half-priced MetroCards and OMNY accounts. You might have also noticed the marketing push for Fair Fares we’ve been doing onboard trains and in stations.

Special focus is being given to encouraging students to develop good habits about paying the fare – an important civic responsibility. MTA launched a rewards program this spring to boost student MetroCard usage, and we’re also working closely with the NYC Department of Education to increase compliance as we complete the transition to OMNY tap-to-pay for students next school year.

But until we can get those determined not to pay to follow the rules, we’ll still need to strategically deploy enforcement. So far this year, NYPD officers have issued twice as many summonses as they did in 2019 – more than 48,000 as of May 19.

We’ve also hired unarmed gate guards to patrol the fare area – especially emergency gates — at 50 specially selected subway stations. Since they arrived, there’s been an estimated 20-30% decrease in fare evasion levels at those stations. New York City Transit has committed to increasing the number of gate guards from 471 to 1,000 systemwide in the next few months.

The fourth E – Environment – will take the most time to address, since it involves redesigning turnstiles and all the fare infrastructure at all 472 subway stations. In the short term, we’ve upgraded 1,400 turnstiles at more than 100 locations to prevent back-cocking and installed jump-deterring turnstile fins at four pilot stations. With these mitigations, fare evasion has fallen more than 20% at those locations.

Putting a 15-second time delay on the opening of emergency gates – the superhighways of fare evasion — has been another success, leading to a 38% decrease in evasion through the gate at three pilot stations. You can expect an expansion of this program in the coming months.

But eventually, we’ll need to think bigger. Last year, we started testing new accessible wide-aisle gates at Atlantic Av-Barclays Center, 34 St ACE, Astoria Blvd NW and introduced a new full array of those gates at Sutphin Blvd-Archer Av EJZ, where fare payment increased by 20% compared to 2023. At least another 10 stations will get an improved version of those gates this year while we begin testing new technologies at MTA’s Fare Evasion Lab this summer.

Bottom line — we’ve got to get a handle on pervasive fare evasion. It’s a threat not only to the MTA’s finances – and our ability to provide service – but also to the spirit of mutual respect and fair play that makes New York not just a great City, but a great community.",https://www.amny.com/opinion/we-must-do-something-about-pervasive-fare-evasion/
MTA reveals farebeating cost $690M last year as it rolls out plan to cut losses,2023-05-17 00:00:00,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority revealed Wednesday that fare evasion cost the agency as much as $690 million last year — as it announced plans for dramatic changes to the systems designed to cut losses.

The plan to beat the farebeaters — who the MTA said make up a third of bus riders and about 13% of subway straphangers — includes new high-tech subway gates, escalating penalties for not paying, boosted enforcement on buses, simplification of student MetroCards and a public awareness campaign.

“We have found that fare evasion is at crisis levels across the transit system and the problem is much bigger than anyone thinks,” said the panel’s co-chairwoman, Rosemonde Pierre-Louis. “Without fares and tolls, the MTA could not provide anywhere near the quality of mass transit service that New York demands.”

The report from the MTA’s ‘blue ribbon’ panel detailing the recommendations to combat fare evasion is more than 120 pages long and nearly a year in the making.

“We can’t put at risk of working class and middle class New Yorkers to get where they need to go,” said MTA chairman Janno Lieber. “That is money that could be used to provide more service, more frequent service, more reliable service. It could be used to invest in infrastructure.”

4 MTA chairman Janno Lieber (left, in focus) stands by the co-chairwoman of the agency’s panel examining fare beating, Rosemonde Pierre-Louis (right) James Messerschmidt for NY Post

The report shows that the bulk of the MTA’s losses from fare-beating come from buses in the five boroughs, where agency data shows that one-in-every-three passengers are boarding without paying the fare, costing the agency as much as $315 million annually — nearly half of all the money that was lost.

Under questioning, agency leaders conceded that some of those riders may have paid the fare earlier when boarding the subway but then failed to swipe their MetroCard or tap the card they used for OMNY again on the bus, meaning the free transfer was never logged and the actual losses could be lower.

Additionally, drivers commonly wave passengers onboard during the rush hour or when buses are particularly packed so they can keep to their schedules, likely exacerbating the losses.

The report found that one-in-eight subway riders skip the fare too, costing the MTA an estimated $285 million annually.

Roughly half of the fare evasion comes from straphangers flowing through emergency exit doors that are either propped open or unlocked, while the rest comes from riders either jumping, slipping through or ducking underneath the turnstiles.

The MTA demonstrated four new potential fare gates designs at the press conference, which they say would replace the iconic turnstile with pairs of large plastic doors that are several feet tall and sit just inches above the floor, making it vastly more to slip inside without paying.

The new high-tech system also has the ability to open the gates automatically in the midst of an emergency, which MTA officials hope will allow the new designs to permanently do away with the emergency doors they’ve described as the “super highways” of fare evasion.

Officials would not provide a timeline for when they hoped to begin installing the new gates, even as agency officials, including Lieber, publicly demonstrated four models brought by manufacturers from which MTA may purchase.

However, the 124-page report included a tantalizing hint of the stations that officials may be eyeing as first in line for the overhaul — featuring renderings of how the new fare gates may reshape the main concourses of the Jay Street/Metrotech and the 34th St./Hudson Yards stops.

4 Officials would not provide a timeline for when they hoped to begin installing the new gates. James Messerschmidt for NY Post

One of the models, made by Conduent, was developed in conjunction with the French national railroad with the goal of cutting fare-beating on their suburban Paris routes in half.

The model is currently used at one of their largest stations, which handles more than 1,600 trains and 400,000 passengers daily.

Officials in Philadelphia have recently okayed spending nearly $1 million to test-drive the model by installing it at two of their elevated metro stations in a bid to reduce fare-beating, too.

Another manufacturer, Easier, brought two models, one of which a Post reporter put to the test by attempting — and failing — to jump over the higher barrier. One of the models appears to be nearly identical to the gates commonly used by the Paris’s express rail network.

The fourth model, made by Scheidt-Bachmann, appeared to be nearly identical to the versions manufactured by the firm that are already use in the London Tube system and at Boston’s major commuter rail stations.

The MTA’s report also chalked up some of the fare evasion to the extraordinarily complicated student MetroCard system, which it says should be simplified and expanded.

Currently, students can qualify for one of nine different types of cards, which the MTA says should be standardized to just one student card when the system moves over to OMNY.

Additionally, the agency said it will ask the city and state to pay for expanding the number of free rides provided by students from three rides a day to five and to allow those rides to be used any day of the week, whereas the current program typically restricts them to weekdays.

The panel also recommended that MTA officials ask state lawmakers to okay tweaks to statutes that would allow the agency’s fare enforcement agents to issue formal first warnings without a summons — but seek the power to escalate the fines against repeat offenders.

There were significant losses on the commuter railroads, too. The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North lost a combined $40 million to fare evasion and riders using incorrect tickets for the train they’re on and the conductor doesn’t collect the difference.

The report determined that fare-beating and undercharging was more common on the LIRR than on Metro-North last year, despite the LIRR’s practice of putting more conductors on the average train than its sister railroad does.

The panel recommended that the MTA consider cutting down on the number of ticket types sold by the LIRR and Metro-North as one way to address the problem and that it “explore” the feasibility of installing fare gates at major stations, like Boston and Philadelphia have done.",https://nypost.com/2023/05/17/mta-reveals-farebeating-cost-690m-last-year-as-it-rolls-out-plan-to-cut-losses/
NYC Transit Authorities Intensify Crackdown on Fare Evasion,2023-05-21 14:05:34-04:00,"Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

Law enforcement issued 80% more summonses throughout the New York City Transit system during the first three months of 2023 compared to the same period last year — a considerable increase as the MTA seeks to deter fare evasion in the system.

The MTA’s Transit Adjudication Bureau, which processes summonses handed out for violations of the MTA rules of conduct, reported over the weekend that police and civilian inspectors issued 54,692 summonses in the subway system and on buses in the first quarter of 2023, compared to 30,382 in the first quarter of 2022. The majority of the summonses were for fare evasion, according to data published by the authority.

Accordingly, the MTA collected 66.8% more revenue from summonses this year compared to last — bringing in $3,353,234 to agency coffers. Surplus revenue compared to expenses increased by 107% to $2,265,496.

The news comes just days after the MTA released a long-awaited report estimating it lost nearly $700 million to fare and toll evasion in 2022, a number that has grown to “crisis levels” since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. About 37% of bus riders and 13.5% of subway riders are estimated to skip the $2.75 fare on any given day.

The “blue ribbon” report recommended redesigning fare gates to be more difficult to cross without paying and expanding benefits like Fair Fares for low-income riders.

Notably, the panel also recommended that the MTA shift to civilian enforcement for most fare evasion cases, and by extension keep armed police out of the equation. In the past year, the agency has deployed unarmed, private security contractors to guard fare arrays to deter turnstile hopping, and it plans to expand civilian “Eagle” teams that can write $100 fare evasion tickets on buses. The panel has also recommended shifting to a model of warning evaders the first time they’re caught, instead of immediately issuing a summons.

But officially, the report’s recommendations are only just that. Last week, when asked if he would tell the NYPD to “back off” on its beefed-up fare evasion policing given the report’s findings, MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber pointedly declined to do so, saying both he and Transit Bureau Chief Michael Kemper still had to review the 124-page document.

“At this point, I think what we need to do is give the NYPD an opportunity to review the report,” Lieber told reporters at Grand Central Terminal on Wednesday. “And then we’ll have further dialogue on how they’re gonna implement some of these ideas and we’re gonna work together.”

The NYPD has considerably beefed up its presence in the subway system over the past year after a series of high-profile crimes on the rails, including the shoving death of Michelle Go last January and the April 2022 N train mass shooting in Brooklyn. In October, Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams announced a strategy of establishing an “omnipresence” of cops in the system by funding hundreds of additional overtime hours daily; the MTA has touted decreased major crime rates in the months since.

The MTA’s approach to fare evasion has often been criticized over the years as excessively punitive compared to the amount of revenue lost with each vault over the turnstile or mosey through the exit gate. Enforcement is also applied at a highly disproportionate against Black and Latino riders: in the fourth quarter of last year, 93% of arrests and 66% of summonses for fare evasion were against Black or Latino riders, well above those groups’ proportion of the city population. First-quarter data on the racial breakdown of enforcement is not yet available.

The Blue Ribbon report recommended “reducing the well-documented impact of fare evasion enforcement on New Yorkers of color” by distributing enforcement efforts more evenly across the city. Presently, many of the stations with the highest levels of fare evasion enforcement are situated in low-income neighborhoods of color.

The risk of a summons or arrest should be just as great for evasion on the Upper East Side as it is in East New York,” reads the report.

The station with the highest number of summonses in the fourth quarter of 2022 was Jay Street-MetroTech in Downtown Brooklyn; the most arrests took place at Broadway Junction in East New York. Both stations are linked by the A and C trains.

While fare evasion summonses were the lion’s share of collars, it wasn’t the only category for which New Yorkers got tickets. Other violations of the New York City Transit code of conduct include smoking, littering, spitting, or relieving oneself in the system, as well as wheeling large carts, making excessive noise, and spending more than an hour in a station’s fare zone. The MTA could not immediately provide an exact breakdown of the summonses.

MTA board member discusses efforts to increase fare evasion enforcement,2024-08-31 00:00:00,"The MTA is ramping up enforcement of fare evasion on buses around the city after MTA estimates revealed nearly half of all riders this year aren’t paying their fare.

The new effort consists of both undercover transit inspectors and uniformed officers out to catch fare beaters. Hundreds of millions of dollars are lost every year due to fare evasion, according to the MTA, including $315 million from buses alone in 2022.

Andrew Albert, an MTA board member and the chairman of the rider advocacy group, the New York City Transit Riders Council, joined “Inside City Hall” Friday and said fare beaters are “depriving the MTA of much needed revenue and that eventually could come out of service and nobody wants to see that.”

Albert attributes the rise in fare evasion, up from 35% in 2023 to 48% this year, to people seeing others get away with it.

“It’s like the thing to do now — stick it to the man. It’s terrible,” Albert said, going on to describe a scene at an MTA hearing in Brooklyn. “A woman got up in tears and she said ‘you know I want to do the right thing but I see people coming in the rear doors and I say what am I, an idiot? Why should I pay if they’re not?’ And I don’t want anyone to feel like an idiot for doing the right thing and paying their fare.”

Fines for fare evasion range from $50 to $100. The undercover EAGLE team previously only covered SBS bus routes but have now expanded to cover regular buses as well. Riders won’t know if an agent will be on their bus until after they board.

Some state officials have proposed simply making the buses free, a system that was implemented during the pandemic. Albert says the money has to come from somewhere.

“Nothing is free. Somebody would end up having to pay for it. Does that mean the entire state’s taxes would have to pay for it, even if they’re nowhere near New York City?”

While some may think bus drivers are responsible for ensuring riders pay, Albert said that should not be expected of them.

For the subways, Albert said they’re testing out new turnstiles that can’t be hopped over.

“Other cities can dream about a system like this but can’t afford to build it. We’ve built it, and now we need to take care of it,” he said.",https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/inside-city-hall/2024/08/31/mta-board-member-discusses-fare-evasion-enforcement

NEW YORK (WABC) -- There is a new warning for LIRR riders to make sure they pay their fare.

The MTA's TrainTime app has started posting pop-up messages that say, ""MTA police are enforcing fare payment. Passengers who don't pay the fare and don't show valid ID will be removed from the train.""

Passengers have to press a button to acknowledge the message before they can use the app's features.

It comes as fare evasion has run rampant in the regional transportation system. According to the Transit Authority, more than half a million people push their way onto buses or breeze past the subway turnstiles every day.

Veteran commuters say it boils their blood.

""If I have to pay it, everyone else has to pay it,"" said one Metro North commuter.

The MTA has stepped-up enforcement in recent months, a crackdown that includes Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road, where a peak ticket to Huntington costs $17.50, one way.

In the last two years, summonses were up by 120%. Arrests were up 270%. In just the first three months of this year, summonses went up an additional 437% and arrests nearly tripled.

Metro-North conductor Kord Henry says the crackdown is appreciated, and overdue.

""It's been a big problem, you know,"" Henry said. ""People hiding the bathrooms, people avoiding the fares, people arguing with you. Then they refuse to get off. So, a lot of conductors are tired of it. And I think it's about time this happened.""

The MTA said it loses $700 million a year to fare evasion.

Problem rail lines are being targeted for enforcement with officers under orders to eject anyone who refuses to pay the fare.

MTA struggles to find funding as fare hikes remain on the table,2024-09-12 13:10:24-04:00,"Lawmakers are blasting the MTA as it ends its yearlong free bus pilot.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) needs money and is facing a series of “unanswered questions” as its next capital program deadline nears, keeping fare increases on the table, according to a state comptroller’s office report released on Thursday.

The MTA, the state agency that runs the trains and buses in NYC, has to find “billions” in new funds, on top of trying to resolve the $15 billion revenue gap caused by NYS Gov. Kathy Hochul’s congestion pricing pause. The MTA has an extensive list of capital projects that it needs to fund and prioritize including line structures, depots and yards, rail car and bus replacements, and system improvements.

Paying for these projects has proven difficult as the agency lost billions in revenue it had hoped would fund its previous $54.8 billion 2020-2024 capital plan.

Setting priorities for the next capital program is important. Transparency about how and why the projects were chosen is important. Both factors will be key for stakeholders, especially the riders the MTA is trying to win back, NYS Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said.

“The choices that the MTA and the state make in the coming months will determine the future of the transportation system for years to come,” DiNapoli said. “Understanding the options and what’s at stake is key for all stakeholders and riders in particular. It’s my hope that this report will help underscore the priorities and the challenges the MTA faces in paying for the upcoming capital program.”

And time is of the essence. Per law, the MTA must submit its 2025-2029 capital plan to the state capital program review board by Oct. 1.

John J. McCarthy, policy and external relations chief at the MTA, said the agency plans to have a detailed plan soon.

“We appreciate this serious analysis from the comptroller, and intend to lay out a detailed capital plan this month that will follow the same needs-based approach taken in his report,” he said.

Adding to the MTA’s bill in addition to ongoing capital projects is subway accessibility improvement. Per a court agreement, the MTA has to increase subway accessibility to meet the requirement of the Americans with Disabilities Act for all stations by 2055. This may require any amount from $5.3 to $8.1 billion in the next capital program, depending on the size of investment in NYC Transit projects, the comptroller’s report says.

Fare increases are on the table

DiNapoli’s report lists ways the MTA can choose to get more money and pay off debt. A fare increase is one option.

The report assumes between 13% and 18% of increases in MTA-sourced revenue, primarily fares and tolls, could be used to pay debt service.

And bouts of fare evasion have not helped alleviate the MTA’s funding challenges.

By collecting the estimated $700 million in lost revenue from fare evasion, the agency could generate about $1.5 to $2.1 billion in capital from debt issuance. Doubling fares beyond the 4% increase scheduled for 2025 could add $300 million in revenue, excluding the impact from potential decreases in ridership, increasing the MTA’s bond capacity by $600 to $900 million.

Danny Pearlstein, policy and communications director of the Riders Alliance, said DiNapoli’s report highlights the “mistake” Hochul is making by not implementing congestion pricing.

“Governor Hochul needs to start congestion pricing now to meet riders’ needs and give Albany leaders a clean opportunity to debate major new funding in the budget,” he said. “The comptroller’s report reinforces the magnitude of the governor’s mistake in stopping the program before it began.”

Pearlstein added that halting congestion pricing could result in fare increases and service disruptions.

“If Governor Hochul’s congestion pricing pause extends into 2025, she and the legislature will face impossible choices that will lead to mounting delays, fare hikes and service cuts and threaten a death spiral in the public transit system that makes New York possible,” Pearlstein said.",https://www.amny.com/transit/mta-money-congestion-pricing/
MTA tests out new subway gates designed to keep fare-jumpers out,2023-12-04 00:00:00,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has installed its first harder-to-jump fare gates at a Queens station as part of a test of potential designs aimed at stanching the fare-beating crisis that stole $690 million from the agency’s coffers last year.

The new array at the Sutphin Boulevard-Archer Avenue station replaces the decades-old turnstiles with barriers that feature taller paddles that make them harder to jump or crawl under, which swing open and then close after tapping in via OMNY or swiping a MetroCard.

“I don’t think I’ve seen technology that’s perfect in any city, frankly,” said Rich Davey, the MTA’s top executive for the city subway and bus systems, at the official unveiling Monday. “But this is obviously going a long way to improving our current turnstile system.”

The paddles allow straphangers with bags or luggage to easily walk through, an advantage that made the Sutphin Boulevard stop a logical first spot because it connects to the JFK Airtrain via the larger Jamaica Station complex.

The 8th Avenue-Penn Station A/C/E will be the second station to get the new setup, which is due to be installed next week, officials said. The cost to outfit the station was $700,000.

These new gates are manufactured by Cubic Corporation, the contractor behind the MTA’s massively delayed and buggy OMNY fare payment system.

However, officials had few other details about the new pilot program immediately available, including its price tag and how the gates were purchased, as the MTA bureaucracy has yet to formally issue its request for device specifications to other major vendors.

4 Officials say the paddles make it far easier for riders with bags or suitcases and for riders with strollers, in wheelchairs or dealing with other disabilities to use the subways. Dennis A. Clark

“These are the gates that we found that were available to us today,” said Quemuel Arroyo, the MTA executive who oversees the agency’s program to improve access for the disabled.

The installation comes seven months after the MTA revealed several demonstration models of fare gates that are commonly used in other major US and European transit systems as potential replacements for its turnstile setups.

They typically featured either tall paddles or double-leaf plastic barriers that are far harder to jump over or crawl under than the current waist-high turnstiles.

MTA chairman Janno Lieber has also said he hopes the Fire Department will approve changes to the station designs that will allow the agency to do away with the emergency fare gates that are often propped open, which he’s dubbed the “superhighway” of fare evasion.

MTA giving extra free ride to NYC students in hopes of curbing record-breaking farebeating,2024-07-25 00:00:00,"The MTA is expanding its free metrocard program for city schoolkids — in a bid to combat record-breaking levels of farebeating, officials said Thursday.

New York City students will be able to ride the subway without charge up to four times per day — at any time and even when school is out, starting next month.

Previously, students received three free rides per day, and they could only use the cards from 5:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. on schooldays.

“When it comes down to students, they’re doing it (evading fares) out of necessity or they are trying to get to school, they’re trying to pick up their niece and nephew or their sibling, and they just don’t have the money to do so,” Mayor Eric Adams said during a press conference with MTA boss Janno Lieber.

4 Mayor Eric Adams said students jump the turnstile out of “necessity”. Gabriella Bass

“We are attempting to make it easier for these young people to not have a record because they’re trying to carry out a an activity that they must do,” he said.

The initiative was part of a recommendation made by a panel convened by the MTA last year to study the transit system’s “crisis level” of fare evasion.

Fare evasion cost the MTA an eye-watering $690 million last year, though it’s not clear how many of those skipping the swipe were students.

The panel reported that fare evasion spikes from 3 to 4 p.m., coinciding with school dismissal time, and isn’t as prevalent during the morning rush-hour.

Some students told a focus group organized by the panel they resort to jumping the turnstile because they don’t get enough free rides to attend internships or other extracurricular activities.

Transit Tech student Malik Inniss, 17, said he needs more daily swipes to get to and from football games and internships.

“When it comes to traveling in the city, I have to transfer from the bus to the train, back to the train then the bus. Only having an ability to use the card three times is not enough — that one extra time would get me that last trip to get home,” Inniss said, speaking at Adams’ Thursday’s press conference.

4 At least one student admitted jumping the turnstile makes them feel “anonymous and powerful”. Paul Martinka

But the same panel also found that some kids jump the turnstile just for the thrill of it.

“Students talked openly about how evading after school with a group of friends can feel fun and risk-free — ‘anonymous and powerful,’ as one student put it,” reads the report.

Some students also falsely report losing their free metrocards — after selling them to adults, according to the report.

In one 2023 incident reviewed by the panel, a 41-year-old man was stopped for using a student subway card and was found to have a knife, a baton and an open warrant for assault.

While the panel recommended giving students smartphone-based OMNY accounts to keep the kids from losing or selling the cards, Lieber said the MTA won’t be able to offer that option yet.

4 Students told a panel they wanted freedom to use the cards later at night for internships or jobs. Gabriella Bass

Adams estimated the new program would help save students up to $1,000 per month during the summer and $80 per month during the school year in subway fares.

“When you are a student you have to use your MetroCard or your OMNY card to pick up your siblings. You have to use your OMNY card to go to an appointment somewhere, a medical appointment, or go to the library in your community,” he said.

“Every dollar you use to tap is a dollar that won’t be tapped out of your pockets,” he quipped.

The cards will be distributed at New York City schools at the start of the school year.

The city and state together budgeted $75.5 million to cover the program — even though the panel in 2023 estimated the program will cost the MTA twice that at around $150 million.

Lieber said the MTA and New York City Public Schools would be pairing the expanded free rides with a campaign to promote card usage among students, with the department chipping in $50.5 million to cover the expansion.",https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/us-news/mta-giving-extra-free-ride-to-nyc-students-in-hopes-of-curbing-farebeating/
‘Turnstiles Who Needs Them!!': MTA thwarts NYC subway gate scam,2023-08-10 23:44:15+00:00,"The advertisement on Craigslist was meant to sound like a straphanger’s dream.

""$100 and never have to buy a metrocard,"" the seller wrote.

""Fare hikes - No problem,"" he added. ""Turnstiles who needs them!!""

The seller was looking to cash in on a key that he said could open every emergency gate in the NYC subway system, allowing users to bypass the turnstiles and evade the $2.90 cost of a ride.

When contacted by the NBC New York I-Team, the seller agreed to meet — and demonstrate how easy it is to evade the fare and take the MTA for a ride.

“I got mine from somebody who works for the MTA,” the seller said, unaware he was being recorded by the I-Team. “I use my key in front of cops.”

Though he may have managed to slip past the turnstiles without paying in the past, the seller ran into a major roadblock – or better said, a major rail block — on the day he met the I-Team.

Unbeknownst to the seller, NYC Transit had just completed a massive project to install metal caps covering keyholes on every emergency access gate in the subway system. Prior to this year, one of the two keyholes on each gate had been used by MTA employees and various contractors to access platforms for repairs or maintenance. Over time though, some of the keys were copied and some made their way into the hands of those who shouldn’t have them.

Richard Davey, the President of NYC Transit, couldn’t say how many gate keys are illegally circulating in the public – but he said there were too many out there, and the MTA had to block further fraud at the gate.

“So what we’ve done in the last couple of months is change out every key in the system,” Davey said. “Fare evasion is as old as the subway itself, so continuing to get ahead of folks who have an opportunity or a scam, it’s our responsibility to do that.”

The MTA is taking additional steps to stop fare evaders.

According to Davey, fare evasion on the subways hovered between 5-7 percent before the pandemic. But since NYC emerged from COVID restrictions, he says the percentage of cheaters has doubled – with turnstile jumpers costing NYC Transit more than $600 million last year.

Among the strategies to try and reduce cheating, NYC Transit is investigating high-tech turnstiles that have taller glass doors and lower-tech interventions like re-tooling turnstiles so they can’t “back-cock,” a common maneuver used to tilt the metal bars back just a little - so people can squeeze through without paying.

The MTA has also seen success with a simpler strategy – paying private, unarmed security to stand in front of the emergency gates. Over the last year, the agency estimates stations with private gate guards have generated an additional $14 million dollars in fare revenue, a promising sign that more straphangers are following the rules there and paying for their swipes.

Whether it’s people jumping the turnstile, unlatching easy-to-reach emergency exit doors, or hopping on a bus without paying, fare evasion is rampant across the city. NBC New York's Andrew Siff reports.

After capping one of the keyholes on each emergency gate – there is still one operating keyhole left. The remaining keyhole is reserved only for FDNY and NYPD responders who have keys which aren’t easy to copy.

After trying his key at multiple gates, without luck, the Craigslist seller left the subway station – insisting lots of other stations still have keyholes unprotected and vulnerable to the fare beating scam. Later, the I-Team contacted the seller, informing him of the MTA’s keyhole capping program and telling him he’d been recorded while trying to sell the key.

He texted back, asking to see the video and admitting, “The key didn’t work, it wasn’t sold to you or to anyone. And I think the MTA is doing a magnificent job at stopping fare evasion.”",https://www.nbcnewyork.com/investigations/turnstiles-who-needs-them-mta-thwarts-nyc-subway-gate-scam/4581701/
NYC council pushes massive $55M expansion of program to fund half-priced transit fares to poor,2024-06-04 00:00:00,"The City Council is pushing a massive $55 million expansion of a program that funds half-price transit fares for poor New Yorkers – as fare evasion continues to skyrocket.

Speaker Adrienne Adams wants to expand the city’s “Fair Fares” program so that half-off subway and bus fares would be available to 650,000 more residents of the five boroughs, as an estimated 325,000 already get the discount.

“The rising cost of housing, childcare and food is making it difficult for working families to stay in the city they love and build their legacies right here,” Adams said during a press conference Tuesday.

Adams said many New Yorkers struggle to even afford even a one-way fare after a price hike kicked in last August.

This latest expansion push comes just one year after the Fair Fares program was last expanded.

To be eligible for the program now, applicants would have to be at 120% of the federal poverty level or less.

The expansion would increase that number 200%, just a year after it was hiked from 100%.

Although advocates pushed Fair Fares, which launched in 2019, as a program that could provide relief to the fare evasion crisis, it hasn’t helped slow down fare jumpers.

Nearly $700 million in revenue was lost to fare jumpers in 2022 alone. That included $315 million lost in bus fares, $285 million in subway fares, $46 million in bridge and tunnel tolls and $44 million in railroad fares, according to a 2023 PCAC report on fare evasion.

The same report said that more than half of fare evaders are skipping out by simply walking through the emergency exit gates. Another 20% of fare evaders jump or climb over the turnstile.

The largest spike in fare evasion is typically from 3 to 4 p.m. when schools let out, with smaller spikes during the morning rush hour, according to the report. Students are already given free transit passes.

3 Even on public transportation it can cost as much as $6 to get to and from work in New York City. J.C. Rice

Deputy Speaker Diana Ayala said many fare evaders are just low-income New Yorkers trying to get around in a city that keeps hiking the cost of public transport.

“With minimum wage at nearly $16 an hour in our city, paying nearly $6 to go and from work can be a heavy burden on New Yorkers. A reduced fare provides much-needed relief for low-income New Yorkers bearing the brunt of our affordability crisis,” Ayala said.

Meanwhile, the cost of a ride continues to go up.

After pausing its biannual fare hikes during the pandemic, MTA raised the cost of a single ride on MTA’s subway system by 25 cents to $3.25.

To ride an MTA-chauffeured bus one time, a rider must pay $3.25, also up 25 cents.

3 New York City has both the highest poverty rate and the lowest income threshold among large cities with discounted public transportation programs, according to PCAC. jovannig – stock.adobe.com

Straphangers looking for frequent rider deals weren’t spared from the MTA’s price hikes. A 7-day unlimited MetroCard rose $1 to $34 last summer, and a 30-day unlimited pass increased by $5 to $132.

The $55 million expansion would put the Big Apple more in line with programs in other large metropolitan U.S. cities, according to a report from the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA.

The federal poverty level changes based on the size of a person’s household. For example, for a one-person household the federal poverty level is $15,060. For a four-person household, the federal poverty level is $31,200.

Of the 10 most populous U.S. cities with discounted public transit fare programs, New York City has both the highest poverty rate and the lowest income threshold, according to PCAC.

Most cities offer half-off fares for people living at 200 percent of the federal poverty level.

Denver comes in just ahead of New York City. It offers fare discounts to people living at 185 percent of the federal poverty level.

Los Angeles is the most generous city for discounted fares. It offers 20 free rides per month to people making 300 percent or less of the federal poverty level.",https://nypost.com/2024/06/04/us-news/city-council-wants-more-new-yorkers-to-get-discounted-subway-rides/
MTA installs new turnstiles designed to stop fare evasion,2023-12-05 17:10:04+00:00,"The traditional turnstiles at a subway station in Queens have been fully replaced with new wide-aisle fare gates, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced Monday. Designed to increase accessibility and prevent fare evasion, the new fare gates were deployed at the Sutphin Boulevard Archer Avenue-JFK Airport subway station in Jamaica. The fare gates replace the emergency exit gate at the end of the station; more than half of all fare evasion occurs through these emergency gates, according to the MTA.

In May, the MTA unveiled the design prototype for its anti-fare-evasion turnstiles, following the release of a report by the MTA’s Blue-Ribbon Panel on Fare Evasion that found that the transit agency had lost $690 million in unpaid fares and tolls across the system in 2022. Approximately 400,000 daily riders, or 10 to 15 percent of riders, did not pay a fare.

“New York City Transit’s North Star is improving the customer experience, and we are doing just that at Sutphin Blvd by introducing new, easier-to-access, fare gates and by opening our 14th Customer Service Center,” NYC Transit President Richard Davey said.

“Customers traveling to and from JFK with their luggage, commuters transferring from the LIRR at Jamaica, and local commuters can look forward to faster, more accessible journeys, and a more welcoming station environment.”

The new fare gates feature wide aisles, making it easier for those with strollers, wheelchairs, and luggage. Additionally, at the north end of the station’s mezzanine, four traditional turnstiles installed with OMNY technology have been installed to improve customer flow.

The installation marks the first full deployment of the new fare gates in the subway system following a test pilot at the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center station in March 2023. The MTA plans to assess the effects of the new fare gates to determine the possibility of replacing turnstiles at other subway stations in the future.

In addition to the new fare gates, the MTA has opened a new customer service center in the Jamaica station, the 14th center in the entire subway system. Historically, subway customer service has been limited to NYC Transit’s service center at 3 Stone Street in Lower Manhattan. With the new service centers, transit officials can assist commuters directly at stations within their home boroughs.

New York City Transit plans to open another center before the end of the year.

The service centers feature repurposed booths, new retail outlets, improved accessibility, OMNY technology, and a more welcoming visual aesthetic for customers. This includes new lighting, branded wrapping, and canopies with customer service agents ready to assist with signing up for Reduced-Fare, converting riders to OMNY, and other general inquiries.

"To get riders back — indeed, to survive — the MTA must curb fare evasion",2022-04-27 00:00:00,"With ridership at about 60% of pre-COVID normal, the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority has huge problems getting people back on trains right now and faces huge budget deficits in the future. There’s a place where these two problems crash into each other: fare evasion. The MTA is creating an expert commission to advise on how to get people to pay up before it’s too late.

MTA chief Janno Lieber laid out the facts this week: “Law-abiding New Yorkers . . . observe too many of their neighbors slip through an open emergency gate, duck a turnstile or walk onto an MTA bus without paying.” More than 12% of subway “customers” are evading the fare, up from 3% in 2018. On buses, a third of passengers are free-riding.

We all pay the financial cost of fare evasion, in either higher fares or taxes: The MTA will lose half a billion dollars this year to stolen fares.

This cost will grow as evasion reaches what Lieber fears is a “tipping point” because customers are so “demoralized” by watching other people get in free. “Why should I pay when so many others don’t?” they think.

As we’ve seen over the past two years, once a culture of respecting the law and other people is lost, it’s hard to get it back. New York is welcoming a whole generation of newcomers and maturing teenagers who are learning that it’s OK not to pay.

What of the common argument that fare evasion is a crime of poverty? No: It’s a crime of anti-social behavior. The vast majority of poor workers pay their fare. As Mayor Eric Adams has said multiple times, New York has a program — funded by the city — through which poorer residents can receive half-fare MetroCards.

Failing to enforce the law, by contrast, harms poor riders who must contend with crime and disorder. People willing to flout small laws disproportionately flout bigger ones.

Twice last month, cops stopped people for breaking other rules in the subway, walking between cars and lying on the platform, and found they were carrying loaded guns.

The people who take over the corners of subway cars and intimidate other passengers by openly smoking pot or blasting music, daring other customers to stop them — how do you think they got into the subways in the first place?

As Lieber says, “When riders see people breaking the rules — smoking, public urination, open drug use, vandalism — they wonder: What else might that person do to me?”

Of course, mentally ill and homeless adults need help. In the meantime, they can’t drive away customers who are using transit as transportation.

Yet in a recent Partnership for New York City survey, nearly three-quarters of commuters say the trains are less safe than they were pre-COVID, and nearly half of commuters say that “not enough is being done to address turnstile jumping.”

If transit advocates want people to take the train, they have to listen to what riders and former riders are most concerned about.

This does not mean that anyone should go to jail because he forgot his MetroCard. “Failure to pay $2.75 . . . should not change the trajectory of anybody’s life,” said Lieber. Almost all fare evaders receive a civil summons anyway, rather than face misdemeanor arrest.

Some things the commission should consider:

1) A formal warning system. Police claim they give out tens of thousands of warnings each year, in lieu of issuing summonses — but they have no record of such warnings. For a first offense, police could issue a civil ticket that carries no penalty, so that they know whether someone is committing her first offense or her fiftieth.

2) For people who have piled up multiple civil summonses, community service in lieu of a misdemeanor arrest. A community-service requirement for people jumping subway turnstiles because of homelessness or drug addiction could be the first step toward a job and a functional life.

3) More enforcement at racially diverse stations. Police should avoid stings at stations where the majority of customers are black or Hispanic, such as in central Brooklyn or the south Bronx. Instead, as former Police Commissioner Bill Bratton once did, do them at major hubs, and catch everyone who doesn’t pay.

Consistent enforcement won’t catch more people in a dragnet. After a while, as Bratton demonstrated, it will catch fewer people — because people will know not to chance it.

NYPD launches new effort to crack down on subway fare evasion,2024-03-25 00:00:00,"The NYPD is deploying hundreds of additional officers into the subway system as part of a weeklong effort to crack down on fare evasion, officials said Monday.

The initiative, dubbed “Operation Fare Play,” will see 800 officers join an already-increased law enforcement presence underground at “strategic locations based on crime, MTA statistics and community complaints,” NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said at a news briefing.

What You Need To Know The NYPD is deploying hundreds of additional officers into the subway system as part of a weeklong effort to crack down on fare evasion, officials say



The initiative, dubbed “Operation Fare Play,” will see 800 officers join an already-increased law enforcement presence underground at “strategic locations based on crime, MTA statistics and community complaints,” NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said



The NYPD first began ramping up police presence underground at the beginning of February after seeing a spike in transit crime year over year the month prior

The department’s announcement came less than two weeks after a man was shot in the head on a subway train in downtown Brooklyn.

NYPD officials tied the shooting at the Hoyt-Schermerhorn Streets station to fare evasion, saying the man — who was shot with his own gun — evaded the fare as he brought the weapon into the subway system.

“As we told you when we were over at Hoyt-Schermerhorn, the commitment to transit safety starts with theft of service and keeping bad people out of the system,” Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Tarik Sheppard said at Monday’s briefing.

Both uniformed and plainclothes officers will carry out enforcement, NYPD Chief of Transit Michael Kemper said. Officials declined to say which stations the operation would target.

“We’re not giving the locations, because we don’t want people to know,” Chell said. “What we want to let them know is, don’t think you can come down here and get a free ride and bring your weapons.”

The operation, which the NYPD said kicked off Monday, will not be a “one-week deal,” Chell added, noting that the department has plans to “do it time and time again.”

The NYPD first began ramping up police presence underground at the beginning of February after seeing a spike in transit crime year over year the month prior.

Though February saw a drop in overall subway crime, with that “downward trend” continuing into March, Kemper said fare evasion “remains one of the primary complaints from both law-abiding subway riders and the MTA.”

Kemper drew a connection between the crackdown and the NYPD’s ongoing push to keep weapons out of the transit system, saying riders “should not be subjected to open acts of lawlessness anywhere in our subway system.”

“Look, the tone of law and order starts at the turnstiles, right?” he said. “There have been 20 gun arrests so far in the subway system in the [past] seven-and-a-half weeks, for people trying to enter the subway system with guns.”

Advocates, however, have criticized efforts to crack down on fare evaders, arguing enforcement efforts disproportionately target New Yorkers of color, as well as low-income riders.

At Monday’s briefing, Kemper maintained the goal of the operation was not to rack up arrests, but to “correct behavior.”

“It’s behavior that reeks of lawlessness,” he said. “And we need to set that tone of law and order right when the riders come into the subway system, whether they’re law-abiding riders or not.”

The MTA, which Kemper said loses “tens of millions of dollars” to fare evasion each year, threw its support behind the announcement.

“We’re thrilled by the commitment to transit safety demonstrated again and again by Mayor Adams and the NYPD,” MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said in a statement.",https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/03/25/nypd-subway-fare-evasion-operation-fare-play
Hochul backs MTA bid to boost fines for repeat fare-beaters to up to $200 — while letting first-timers off with just a warning,2024-01-16 00:00:00,"Gov. Kathy Hochul is backing the MTA’s push to overhaul how fare-beating is policed with proposals that would increase fines for repeat offenders — but let first-timers off with just a warning.

The plan, endorsed by Hochul in her 2025 budget proposal released to state lawmakers on Tuesday, would create a new “laddered” system of penalties for fare-beating, with a fifth-time offense escalating to a charge of theft of services.

First-time offenders would get a documented warning, which transit officials have backed as a way to formalize the discretion already granted to police officers and fare collectors for cases where someone has lost their wallet or their phone has died.

On the second offense, accused fare-beaters would get a $100 ticket — the current penalty — but $50 of that would go onto an OMNY card in an attempt to turn the scofflaw into a paying customer.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority justified the partial refunding of the fine in its report, saying that it would help encourage better behavior.

A third offense would cost $150, and the fine for a fourth would be $200.

4 New York Gov. Kathy Hochul presented her executive budget for FY2025 on Tuesday. AP

Fare-beaters could have their case dismissed, under the new system, if they show the summons adjudication judge proof that they have enrolled in the subsidized fare program, Fair Fares, for economically struggling New Yorkers.

Overall, fare evasion cost the MTA an estimated $690 million in 2022 — with half of bus riders and 14% of subway commuters allegedly stealing a ride.

Total figures were not yet available for 2023, but officials have warned the losses may be higher.

The agency relies on fares and tolls to fund approximately $7.5 billion of its $19.3 billion annual budget.

4 MTA officials have focused their ire on riders caught on tape jumping the turnstiles while wearing fashionable designs from top brands that suggest they could easily pay. Christopher Sadowski

A system similar to giving first-time offenders tickets already exists on the MTA’s commuter railroads, which allows riders onboard trains without a credit or debit card to have an invoice for their ticket mailed to their home address.

The Long Island Rail Road only calls the cops after a rider has received $100 in ticket vouchers.

The new penalties laid out in the plan endorsed by Hochul would be part of the MTA’s multi-pronged effort to try and curb fare-beating.

Officials recently installed new fare gates at the Sutphin Boulevard-Archer Avenue station in Queens that swap out the classic turnstile for paddle-like doors as part of a program experimenting with new designs that are harder to beat and could be rolled out across the system.

However, The Post and a TikTok video star revealed that the system could be easily defeated thanks to a poorly placed door sensor that can be easily activated by just leaning over.

Other designs the agency is considering — including those used by the Paris rail and metro lines — include much taller doors that would be difficult, if not impossible, to reach across or jump over.

Additionally, Hochul’s budget proposal would allocate $61 million to push ahead with the engineering and design work on two high-profile transit projects she has adopted as her own.

The first, the Interborough Express, would use space alongside freight tracks that run from Sunset Park in Brooklyn to Jackson Heights in Queens for a new circumference rail line that would link the two boroughs together and provide connections to more than a dozen subway lines.

Officials say the $5.5 billion-14 mile system would net nearly 120,000 daily riders, speed up commutes and help slash congestion and pollution caused by cross-borough and intra-borough traffic.

The second calls for examining a possible western extension of the Second Avenue Subway from its current planned terminus at 125th St.-Lexington Avenue all the to 125th St.-Broadway, giving uptown Manhattan its first crosstown line.

The $7.5 billion extension would allow riders in Harlem to easily transfer between the A/B/C/D, No. 1, No. 2/3 and No. 4/5/6 trains without having to trek all the way to Midtown — and help relieve congestion on 125th St., which is one of the busiest bus routes in the city.

Transit officials have said they may be able to get the price tag down to $7.1 billion if they can keep the tunnel boring machines they plan to use for the extension to Lexington Avenue in the ground and continue digging westward.",https://nypost.com/2024/01/16/metro/hochul-backs-bid-to-boost-fines-for-repeat-fare-beaters-to-up-to-200/
UPDATE: Open Door for Fare Evaders at West 86th Street Subway Station,2024-07-11 00:00:00,"UPDATE: Friday at 1 p.m. July 12: After West Side Rag contacted the MTA and published this story Thursday afternoon, the Rag visited the West 86th Street #1 station at evening rush hour and again late Friday morning. Private security guards had been deployed on the downtown platform, and NYPD officers patrolled the uptown platform during WSR’s evening visit. On Friday morning, security guards were back on the downtown side, and WSR saw them stop at least half a dozen people from attempting to enter through the unlocked gate without paying. However, there was no one guarding the uptown side, and a steady flow of fare evaders continued to simply walk onto the platform.

One security guard told the Rag there were plans to fix the gate locks “over the next week.”

By Ed Hersh

After weeks of renovations and closures, the 86th Street #1 train platforms reopened in late June with new floors, new lighting, and new benches — but with something else as well: gates with no locks that allow fare evaders unfettered access to the platforms.

The emergency gates, which are usually locked from the inside with a “panic bar,” have had no visible locking mechanisms inside or outside for weeks since the station reopened. As the West Side Rag watched on a recent morning, non-paying passengers walked in freely on both the downtown and uptown platforms, and others held the gate open for fare evaders to enter.

Ironically, it was just back in May that the MTA announced a major crackdown on fare evasion, estimated by the Citizens’ Budget Commission to have cost a whopping $690 million in lost revenue in 2023 alone, according to City & State news site.

“People who pay say, ‘Why am I a sucker seeing everybody walk through the gate?’” MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber told City & State in May. “It creates a sense of disorder in a public space where you really can’t have that feeling. People are not going to feel safe if they see everybody breaking the rules before they even get on the subway.”

But that’s just what I witnessed on both the uptown and downtown sides of the 86th Street station. I was on the downtown side as several people waited for a train to arrive and then simply walked in and onto the train. “They say they are waiting for new hardware,” a station employee standing outside the token booth said, as I watched people walk by him and through the gates unimpeded. “People just don’t care.”

West Side Rag contacted the MTA for comment and received this emailed response from spokesperson Joana Flores:

“The MTA has contacted the contractor responsible for performing select repairs and asset replacement at that subway station and surrounding fare array. The contractor is correcting the condition. Until that occurs however, security guards have been sent to the station to ensure customers pay the fare when entering.”

The Rag, however, did not initially see any security personnel during several recent rush-hour visits early on Thursday, but did spot the new guards that evening and again on Friday morning.

The Rag also contacted City Councilmember Gale Brewer’s office Wednesday. She emailed back that she had not been aware of the situation, but after we shared our reporting with her, she said: “I contacted the MTA and it is my understanding that they are expecting to receive temporary hardware tonight (Wednesday) with installation commencing tomorrow through Friday. This temporary fix will secure the gate.”

MTA announces new fare evasion panel as agency projects $500M in annual lost revenue,2022-04-27 14:19:24.606000+00:00,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The MTA is stepping up its efforts to combat fare evasion, with the agency expected to lose roughly $500 million in fare revenue in 2022.

On Tuesday, MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber announced the formation of a “Fareness” panel focused on analyzing and recommending new ways to discourage fare evasion through a three-pronged approach emphasizing education, equity and enforcement.

“Our New York sense of fairness and community is violated when rule-abiding, honest folks -- people who tap or swipe because they know it’s the right thing to do, even if it’s a stretch economically -- see others dodging the fare,” Lieber said.

Fare and toll revenue play a crucial role in financially supporting the MTA, with the two combining to account for roughly 50% of the agency’s operating budget.

Fare evasion has long been an issue for the MTA, but recent rises in the frequency of flouted fares could cost the agency over half a billion dollars in 2022 alone, according to agency projections.

“At current rates, fare beating is going to cost us over $500 million just this year,” Lieber said. “Unless the agency is financially stable, we won’t be able to do what it takes to support New York’s economic comeback or to achieve our climate goals.”

In recent years, the fare evasion rate on MTA subways has skyrocketed from 3% to over 12%, the agency said.

The situation is even worse on buses, where the agency estimates that roughly 33% of riders forego paying their fare.

And it’s not just on the subways and buses where the MTA is losing out on potential revenue.

Since transitioning to cashless tolling on the agency’s bridges and tunnels in 2017, the MTA has issued over 31,000 summonses to motorists using covered or obstructed license plates to avoid paying tolls.

The panel will focus on identifying ways to educate the riding public on the importance of fare payment across various platforms, stressing the crucial role that fare and toll revenue play in the agency’s ability to provide high levels of service.

In terms of equity, panelists will assess new ways to ensure that the transit system is affordable and accessible for low-income New Yorkers, in part by re-evaluating the city’s Fair Fares program, which grants discounted transit trips to those living below the federal poverty line, but is only used by about one-quarter of all eligible residents.

From an enforcement perspective, the panel will consider ways to deter fare evasion through civil fines while ensuring that particular groups are not disproportionately impacted by the agency’s enforcement efforts.

“Fare evasion is a problem we need to solve together. That’s why I am convening a panel of distinguished New Yorkers to take a deep dive into the issue. The goal is to hit the reset button on how we approach fare evasion at the MTA and across government,” said Lieber.",https://www.silive.com/news/2022/04/mta-announces-new-fare-evasion-panel-as-agency-projects-500m-in-annual-lost-revenue.html

NEW YORK (WABC) -- The MTA's board met Wednesday to discuss its operating budget, which is expected to be in a deficit in less than five years.

The budget is now expected to be in deficit in the last two years of the five-year projection.

MTA officials cite an increase in fare evasion, which is draining operational costs, as well as declines in projected tax receipts and commercial mortgage taxes.

Officials say more than 40% of bus riders are not paying, driving subway and bus revenue down 5.5%. MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said a crackdown is coming.

Before the pandemic, fares made up 37% of the MTA's operating budget -- now it has dropped to 26%.

""We let people get out of the habit of paying for buses during COVID because we were trying to protect the drivers at the front, and everybody goes to the back door, and nobody paid. And it's hard to put that genie back in the bottle,"" Lieber said.

Lieber said the agency is buying new subway turnstiles that are harder to jump as well as ""reengineering the (existing) turnstiles, which are highly problematic.""

While the operating budget is not directly affected by the indefinite pause in implementing congestion pricing, the board must consider the ramifications of the loss of that revenue to its operating budget, specifically on $550 million in planned infrastructure.

As for capital projects, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Tuesday she is still weighing alternative ways of raising cash to pay for $16.5 billion in infrastructure initially earmarked from congestion pricing revenue.

She indicated there would not be a resolution until the state legislature reconvenes early next year. She did however announce a creative way to continue Second Avenue Subway construction by diverting $54 million from a discretionary fund reserved for infrastructure upgrades to the subway project.

MTA officials say they trust her to find the funding.

""She delivered last year. She's promised to deliver again and that's her job as the chief executive the State of New York,"" said MTA Board member Neal Zuckerman.

But not everyone is taking the governor at her word. A rally was held before the MTA meeting by supporters for congestion pricing. They say Hochul's message has been clear: they feel they don't matter and her word is not enough.

""The cancelation of congestion pricing is a slap in the face of the millions of New Yorkers who were promised better transit, safer streets, and a sustainable plan for the future,"" said Kathy Park Price with Transportation Alternatives.

Others said her announcement to fund the Second Avenue subway expansion project isn't enough.

""To her we say a $54 million band-aid is not enough to cover a $16.5 billion open wound,"" said Paul Medvetsky with Riders Alliance. ""She's gone in the media to say she will plug this hole, she will secure MTA funding, but she shies away from saying she will introduce congestion pricing or flip the switch now.""

Making MTA buses free is just another surrender to crime,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"Deputy Senate Majority Leader Michael Gianaris is leading the push in Albany for a permanent $45 million fare-free MTA bus program — the latest cave-in to lawlessness.

MTA stats show that fare evasion on buses and subways continues to rise, along with disorder in the transit system.

Farebeaters now cost the MTA $690 million a year; the crime’s grown so routine on city buses that many routes are practically free already.

Sorry: Paying $2.90 to cross the city is cheap; skipping the fare isn’t a “crime of poverty,” it’s a sign of arrogant contempt for everyone else.

And paying the fare is vital to maintaining basic order — a symbolic signing of the social contract.

Indeed, decades of data show that farebeating arrests enable cops to nab illegal gun-toters and other criminals — and reduce overall crime.

Maybe that’s why Gianaris (D-Queens) is pushing to expand the pilot $15 million taxpayer-funded fare-free program that’s operated on five MTA routes (one per borough) since last September: He’s grown so pro-crime that he wants to eliminate a proven way to get perps off the street.

With harrowing acts of criminality becoming commonplace in the transit system, now is not the time to toss in the towel.

If lawmakers want to give the MTA more cash, it shouldn’t be to endorse fare evasion, but to fight it.",https://nypost.com/2024/04/01/opinion/making-mta-buses-free-is-just-another-surrender-to-crime/

Hochul’s lame plan to reduce NYC farebeating won’t change a thing,2024-01-18 00:00:00,"Let’s be honest.

Gov. Hochul’s proposal to reduce farebeating will do next to nothing.

First, let’s look at the scope of the problem.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority says it loses $690 million a year from people jumping the turnstile or boarding buses without paying.

At $2.90 a pop, that is more than 238 million fare beats a year — or 652,000 each day.

The NYPD issued around 120,000 civil summonses for farebeating last year, the most since it started publishing records on its website in 2018.

That means there’s only about a 1 in 2,000 chance of getting a summons.

So of the more than 652,000 fare beats every day in New York City, just 329 result in a summons.

The NYPD in 2023 arrested about 4,400 people for fare evasion — 1 arrest for every 54,000 evasions.

Now the governor wants to give them a pass the first time they get caught.

Under her plan, they’ll be issued a “warning” and told not to do it again, instead of receiving a $100 fine.

This is getting tough?

Right now, there are 652,000 fare beats every day with a 1 in 2,000 chance of the evaders getting a $100 fine.

How many will try to beat the fare when the only consequence is a “warning”?

Under the governor’s plan, if they get caught a second time, they get a $100 fine — but half of that goes to an OMNY card for the farebeater.

So the new penalty for a second offense is really only a $50 fine, half the current $100 fine.

On the third offense, the fine goes to $150, and the fourth is $200.

It’s not until the fifth time they face arrest, only for the district attorneys’ offices to decline prosecution.

And remember, there is only a 1 in 54,000 chance of even getting arrested.

The attack on farebeating arrests was always a phony one.

NYPD policy for decades has been that the first and second time people get stopped for farebeating, they get a civil summons and a $100 fine.

They do not get a criminal record.

Only the third time do they face criminal prosecution, and then it is by desk-appearance ticket, which is a summons returnable in criminal court.

Most of those are disposed of with no criminal record attached.

Our elected officials continue to treat “minor” crimes as “crimes of poverty.”

They paint farebeaters as poor people on their way to work who jump a turnstile because the fare is too high.

To deal with that, the city in 2019 started the Fair Fares NYC program offering half-price metro cards to low-income New Yorkers.

More than 300,000 New Yorkers are enrolled.

Yet fare evasion has doubled since the program began.

Poverty went down in the Big Apple even as farebeating surged.

The politicians claim people shoplift to feed their families, in spite of hundreds of food pantries and soup kitchens, nutrition grants, free lunches and breakfasts for schoolchildren and numerous other programs around the city — and despite the fact just 327 people are responsible for one-third of all New York City shoplifting arrests.

The problem is our city politicians do not take farebeating seriously, and if they don’t, why should citizens?

Legislators treat farebeaters as victims of an unfair system rather than the petty thieves they are, with predictable results.

Cyrus Vance, then Manhattan district attorney, started the avalanche of farebeaters in July 2017 when he announced his office would no longer prosecute farebeating as a crime.

In the last three months of 2017 (the earliest numbers on its website), the NYPD made 3,296 arrests for fare evasion, again arresting only those people who had been given two prior civil summonses.

In the last three months of 2018, as Vance’s policy became more public and Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez joined in, the number of farebeating arrests went down almost 75%, to 858.

In all of 2022, the NYPD made just 1,897 arrests for fare evasion.

In 2023, arrests rose to about 4,400 a year out of 238 million offenses, still far below 2017 numbers.

The result of these policies?

Losses from fare evasion doubled from $150 million in 2017, before the no-prosecution policies, to $300 million in 2019, and then soared to a $690 million loss last year.

I’m not saying arresting people will stop fare evasion.

But it has to be part of an overall policy that is designed to discourage, not excuse, fare evasion.

As a paying transit rider, it is both infuriating and disheartening to see people — obviously not “poor and downtrodden” — walking through emergency exits or jumping over turnstiles to gain entry without paying.

It adds immeasurably to the sense of disorder and chaos that is starting to engulf this still-great city.

And that is ultimately far more damaging than the loss of “a mere” $690 million.

Hochul supports increasing fines for repeat fare beaters,2024-01-17 00:00:00,"Fare payments are up 20% at the Sutphin Boulevard-Archer Avenue-JFK Airport subway station since the MTA installed new fare gates in December, transit officials said.

That’s despite videos, like one that recently went viral, showing how easy it is to manipulate the gate to skip paying.

What You Need To Know In her 2025 state budget proposal, Gov. Kathy Hochul voiced support for escalating fines for each time a fare evader is caught skipping out on payment



Under the new plan, first-time fare beaters would get off with just a documented warning



The second offense would result in a fine of $100, with half of that money paying for an OMNY card to turn offenders into paying customers and encourage better behavior



A third-time offense kicks the fine up to $150, followed by $200 for a fourth offense

On Wednesday morning, MTA police officers stood on the other side of the gates to deter any fare beating.

Cracking down on fare evasion has been a focus for the MTA as its costs increase. In 2022, the agency said it lost out on nearly $700 million due to fare and toll evasion.

An overhaul with respect to how fare evasion is policed is the next move, according to Gov. Kathy Hochul. In her 2025 state budget proposal, Hochul voiced support for escalating fines for each time a fare evader is caught skipping out on payment.

Currently, the fine for fare evasion is $100, no matter how many times someone is caught.

“I think it's important for us to be paying our fares, because that keeps the trains running. It gets us to work on time, so I'm supportive of it,” said commuter Sanu Jaitley.

Under the new plan, first-time fare beaters would get off with just a documented warning.

The second offense would result in a fine of $100, with half of that money paying for an OMNY card to turn offenders into paying customers and encourage better behavior.

“That is ridiculous,” said Kay White Paniagua. “Why would you actually give somebody an incentive to do bad again?”

A third time offense kicks the fine up to $150, followed by $200 for a fourth offense.

Get caught a fifth time? Face the criminal charge of theft of service.

“They’ll think about it the next time,"" said Anthony Beard, another straphanger. ""The next time is always, you got a consequence, you know, to think about. If you do it, they'll go to jail or get more fines.""

Within this plan, there is a stipulation that fare evaders can have their case dismissed against them if they enroll in the MTA's Fair Fares program, which offers reduced fares for those who meet certain income requirements.",https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/01/17/hochul-supports-increasing-fines-for-repeat-fare-beaters
Subway emergency exit gates at some stations to test 15-second delay to help deter fare evasion,2024-01-30 15:20:00+00:00,"Subway emergency exit gates at some stations to test 15-second delay to help deter fare evasion

NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- The MTA has been rolling out pilot programs targeting fare evasion and trying to make riders feel safer. One such measure will put emergency exit gates on a 15-second delay.

The MTA got approval from the state to implement the pilot program to put emergency gates on a short delay.

Critics are concerned in an actual emergency, waiting 15 seconds to exit could put people in a dangerous situation.

The timed delay will be tried out next month at three subway stations. All three have ample turnstiles for riders to access in case of an actual emergency.

They include the 59th Street-Lexington Avenue Station in Manhattan, the Flushing Avenue Station in Brooklyn, and the 138th Street Station in the Bronx.

The MTA has already tested the delayed gates out at Brooklyn's Borough Hall station.

""They push the bar and push the bar because they were doing it as a matter of convenience, and they kind of said whatever they said and they walked around and went out the turnstile, so that's the goal is to frustrate folks,"" said NYC Transit President Richard Davey.

That's just one of the ideas that the MTA is testing out at various stations. They're also trying to gauge public support, and that has been a challenge.

While some of the strategies have already proven successful, The New York Times said Tuesday morning, ""New Yorkers have not been impressed.""

The MTA installed yellow subway platform barriers at the Clark Street subway station over the weekend, the second station where the gates are being piloted.

In Queens, the Sutphin Boulevard-Archer Avenue station has replaced the turnstiles with glowing green fare gates.

Some transit riders have already figured out how to open the gates without paying, a technique quickly disseminated on TikTok.

Despite the ridicule, revenue at that station has increased by 20% since implementation.

These pilot projects are described by MTA as basic attempts to temporarily resolve complex problems.

Transit officials are looking to see what works and what doesn't. None of the ideas are expected to be long-term.

As NYC Transit President Rich Davey said Monday of some of these challenges, if you don't experience failure, you aren't trying hard enough.

The MTA estimated that for 2022, it lost about $285 million to fare evasion.

However, for 2023, data from the MTA shows 12.7% of subway riders did not pay a fare, resulting in approximately $409 million lost.

"MTA lost $700M to fare evasion, proposes new turnstiles.",2023-05-17 17:50:45-04:00,"Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

The MTA lost nearly $700 million to fare evasion last year and should replace subway turnstiles with glass doors, an agency panel said in a long-awaited report.

The agency’s estimated losses from farebeating have climbed considerably in just a few years, from about $200-300 million before the pandemic, to $500 million last year, and now $690 million, said MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber on Wednesday, including $315 million on city buses and $285 million on subways.

Lieber has called the existing turnstile “too porous,” singling out the emergency exit gate he calls the “superhighway” of fare evasion where one rider propping the door open can enable scores to walk through to the platform without paying. The MTA would still have to approve any new turnstile design, but on Wednesday unveiled potential designs that all, in essence, make vaulting over the subway fare array far more difficult, if not impossible.

The recommendations came in an eagerly-anticipated report from the MTA’s “Blue Ribbon” panel on fare and toll evasion, which was originally supposed to release its findings at the end of last year but was delayed amid discussions with the city’s district attorneys.

The panel estimates that on any given day, 400,000 subway passengers do not pay the fare — about 13.5% of all riders. The numbers are even larger on buses, where about 37% of riders are estimated to skip the fare. The report quotes various unnamed subway riders who told the panel’s investigators that seeing others skip the fare was “demoralizing” and made them “feel like a chump.”

Those numbers are growing to “crisis levels,” especially on buses where ridership was free at the height of the pandemic, and the panel says the problem needs to be nipped in the bud before it becomes both financially calamitous for the MTA and culturally “entrenched” in the city’s fabric.

“We run the risk of having the culture of fare evasion becoming permanently embedded in our community, which…would wreak economic havoc on the MTA,” said Roger Maldonado, one of the blue ribbon panel’s co-chairs. “And perhaps just as importantly, would really be a lasting damage to the moral fabric of our society.”

Measuring fare evasion on buses was relatively straightforward: most MTA buses have sensors above the door automatically counting the number of people entering a bus at any given time, so those numbers were compared against the number of fares counted.

Subways were a bit trickier, and less precise: to measure the phenomenon, the MTA deploys “checkers” randomly to stations across the system about 2,400 times per year to observe unpaid entries, compare their numbers to data collected on paid fares, and use that to estimate a system-wide rate. Elsewhere in the system, fare payment data is counted against unpaid entries tallied by automated sensors like on buses, but those are only in a few stations so far.

The approach to fare evasion by the MTA and NYPD has long been criticized as punitive and overly-reliant on police enforcement and prosecution. That’s compounded by well-documented racial disparities in fare evasion enforcement: 93% of those arrested for fare evasion in the fourth quarter of last year were Black or Latino, and summonses and arrests were somewhat concentrated at stations where the rider population is low-income and largely non-white.

The panel says that going forward, police enforcement should be a last resort reserved for those caught multiple times beating the fare, a person deemed in the report as a “determined evader,” or those who bust MetroCard machines and “enable” evasion. Enforcement should be more evenly distributed at stations across the subway system instead of at stations in economically depressed areas, while on buses, the MTA should expand its civilian “Eagle” security teams that monitor jitneys to ensure payment, the report recommends.

Still, Lieber declined to commit to pushing the NYPD to “back off” on issuing summonses and arrests, which have increased dramatically under the Adams administration, and instead said he will allow the Police Department to independently evaluate the report’s findings and determine next steps.

But mustache-twirling malice is far from the only reason people jump the turnstile, the panel found. Some riders are “opportunistic” evaders who intended to pay but happen upon an opened emergency gate. Others are “frustrated” when they cannot fill up a MetroCard at a machine, and jump the turnstile or go through the emergency gate so they don’t miss their train.

Many students also skip fares as their Student MetroCards only provide a discount on weekdays during certain hours, while many other evaders simply do not have the means to pay.

To fix that, the panel recommends a host of measures beyond enforcement. Among them, there’s doubling the income thresholds for New Yorkers to qualify for Fair Fares, which the City Council has proposed for this year’s budget; expanding free rides for students to five rides per day, any day of the week; and improving signage and audio notifications warning of the penalties for fare-hopping.

Most notably, though, the panel recommends comprehensively redesigning the fare array, replacing the easily-vaultable, thigh-high turnstile with head-height glass doors that open middle-out, and are difficult if not impossible to jump over (amNewYork Metro was unable to do so).

“These fare gates are designed to make it much, much harder for persons to evade paying the fare coming in,” said Maldonado.

Four companies presented their prototypes at Grand Central Terminal and will be subject to a competitive procurement process should the MTA decide to take the plunge and implement a new turnstile. All of the prototypes also render moot the need for an emergency exit gate, as the doors can be opened automatically in the event of an emergency.

MTA spending $1 million a month for private security guards amid crackdown on fare evasion in subway system,2022-12-12 22:41:46+00:00,"Five hundred million dollars – that’s how much the Metropolitan Transportation Authority system is currently losing each year because of fare evasion, transit leaders recently said. As the embattled system has struggled to return to pre-pandemic ridership levels amid public safety concerns and a looming multi-billion budget deficit, New York City police and transit leaders have set their sights on reining in fare evasion.

Some of those efforts have occurred alongside multipronged plans that have bolstered police presence overall – more police in subways has meant more people caught and cited for attempting to dodge payment. Other methods have been more unconventional. Transit authorities revealed Monday that the MTA is currently paying $1 million a month for private security guards, which have been deployed to key stations across the city to watch for fare evaders as part of a pilot program. Leaders are also even considering redesigning subway turnstiles to deter people from vaulting over them.

While testifying at a joint hearing of the City Council transportation and public safety committees Monday morning about their efforts to improve safety on the subway system, transit and police leaders said that these practices – while still in their early days – have already led to improvements. Leaders said subway crime was down 13% this November compared to last year. Customer surveys from the MTA show that public safety is riders’ biggest concern about the subway system.

While fare evasion itself is often harmless when stacked against the rare major violent crimes that have captured headlines and shaken public trust in the system, stopping fare evasion is still an important component to the city’s plan to reduce subway crime, according to Michael Kemper, acting chief of the New York City Police Department’s transit bureau.

“There can’t be signs of lawlessness the second someone walks into a subway system,” he told council members. “Think about the perception that gives the average citizen that’s paying their fare walking in, when their first minute into their journey is observing an atmosphere that is a free for all, it’s lawlessness … That perception travels with them throughout the entire journey and it goes home with them.”

Both transit and police leaders stressed that the purpose of enforcing fare evasion isn’t to arrest or summon people – it’s to discourage a behavior that’s worsened in recent years. Of the 82,000 police contacts for fare evasion this year, about 97% of people who are stopped “walk away minutes later with a civil summons,” Kemper said. The other 3% are arrested and inspected, although in the vast majority of instances those individuals already have active warrants or police discover that they are carrying a firearm.

Transit officials have said that it's important to deter people from hopping over turnstiles or going through the emergency gate at the onset so they can avoid costly fees – particularly when the individual is attempting to avoid paying for financial reasons. The private security guards, who are unarmed and unable to arrest or issue fines, were largely hired for this purpose. When positioned near the large, metal emergency gates, these reinforcements have been a largely successful deterrent in the stations since the pilot program began in May, according to Richard Davey, president of the New York City Transit Authority. There are currently over 200 of these unarmed guards stationed in 14 stations.

“The MTA spends a lot of money collecting fares as a general matter, so we see this as an important investment,” Davey said.” One of the things I’ve heard from customers is if they see someone smoking, if they see someone drinking, if they see someone evading a fare that begins to erode their confidence in the system … If we are not doing our best to begin to enforce our rules – subtly in this case – up front as you come into a station, that's when people begin to feel unsafe.”",https://www.cityandstateny.com/policy/2022/12/mta-spending-1-million-month-private-security-guards-amid-crackdown-fare-evasion-subway-system/380798/
MTA adding private security guards to deter subway fare evasion,2022-10-28 13:10:06.906000+00:00,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The MTA is bringing in reinforcements to help combat the rampant fare evasion that is costing the agency hundreds of millions of dollars on a yearly basis.

During a board meeting this week, MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber announced that the agency has hired unarmed, private security guards in an effort to deter fare evaders and bolster rider safety in the subway system.

“Not every fare evader is a criminal, but experiences show that virtually every criminal is a fare evader, so it’s important for us to have the tools and the deployments to intercept people at the fares and block criminality in the system,” Lieber said. “We’re not going to stop until the transit system is a safe and inviting place for everybody.”

Currently, there are a small number of security guards positioned near the emergency exits of six subway stations, though the agency plans to add an additional 50 guards each month for the next several months.

“Across those six stations, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in fares being paid in just the last six to eight weeks,” said MTA New York City Transit President Rich Davey.

In addition to the help provided by the new security guards, the NYPD has ramped up its enforcement of fare evasion, issuing 60% more summonses for the offense than in recent years.

Fare and toll revenue play a crucial role in financially supporting the MTA, with the two combining to account for roughly 50% of the agency’s operating budget.

Fare evasion has long been an issue for the MTA, but recent rises in the frequency of flouted fares could cost the agency over $500 million dollars in 2022 alone, according to agency projections from earlier this year.

In recent years, the fare evasion rate on MTA subways has skyrocketed from 3% to over 12%, the agency said.

The situation is even worse on buses, where the agency estimates that roughly 33% of riders forego paying their fare.

And it’s not just on the subways and buses where the MTA is losing out on potential revenue.

Since transitioning to cashless tolling on the agency’s bridges and tunnels in 2017, the MTA has issued over 31,000 summonses to motorists using covered or obstructed license plates to avoid paying tolls.

In an effort to address the rising rates of fare evasion, the agency announced the formation of a “Fareness” panel back in April, with the group focused on analyzing and recommending new ways to discourage fare evasion through a three-pronged approach emphasizing education, equity and enforcement.

“Our New York sense of fairness and community is violated when rule-abiding, honest folks -- people who tap or swipe because they know it’s the right thing to do, even if it’s a stretch economically -- see others dodging the fare,” Lieber said at the time.

The panel will focus on identifying ways to educate the riding public on the importance of fare payment across various platforms, stressing the crucial role that fare and toll revenue play in the agency’s ability to provide high levels of service.

In terms of equity, panelists will assess new ways to ensure that the transit system is affordable and accessible for low-income New Yorkers, in part by re-evaluating the city’s Fair Fares program, which grants discounted transit trips to those living below the federal poverty line, but is only used by about one-quarter of all eligible residents.

From an enforcement perspective, the panel will consider ways to deter fare evasion through civil fines while ensuring that particular groups are not disproportionately impacted by the agency’s enforcement efforts.",https://www.silive.com/news/2022/10/mta-adding-private-security-guards-to-deter-subway-fare-evasion.html
New Subway Fare Gates and Platform Barriers Fail to Impress New Yorkers,2024-01-30 00:00:00,"Transit officials have struggled for years with two of the subway system’s most vexing problems: the dozens of people struck by trains every year and the millions of dollars lost to fare beaters. In the latest efforts to find solutions, they are testing new fare gates to stop turnstile jumpers and metal platform barriers to keep riders safe.

New Yorkers have not been impressed.

At the 191st Street station on the No. 1 line in Manhattan, rows of waist-high, canary yellow screens made of perforated metal were bolted onto the platforms earlier this month. The simple fences bridged gaps between the station’s pillars but still left ample openings in which riders could reach the tracks or fall on them.

About 15 miles away at the Sutphin Boulevard-Archer Avenue station in Queens, transit crews have replaced the system’s familiar turnstiles with glowing green fare gates that feature panels that swing open like saloon doors. Some transit riders who wanted to avoid paying their fares had already discovered that they didn’t need to jump over these gates: The panels opened so slowly that two people could squeeze in at once.

The pilot projects are trying to solve intractable problems. Over the last three years, as more riders have returned to transit, more have been hit and killed by trains. And fare evasion drains millions of dollars annually from a system that, until recently, had been on the brink of a fiscal crisis.",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/nyregion/subway-mta-fare-gates.html
"With Fare Evasion Rampant in Bronx, Will ‘Eagle’ Teams Be Enough to Clamp Down?",2022-08-02 00:00:00,"Nearly two years after the MTA resumed collecting fares on buses following a pandemic pause, close to one third of all passengers citywide are not paying for rides, agency data reveals, with more than half in The Bronx riding for free.

“I do it myself — it’s like ‘Follow the Leader,’” Wayne Murphy, 60, told THE CITY while waiting for a Bx15 bus at Third Avenue and Westchester Avenue in The Bronx. “You see Joe do it, then you follow the leader.”

The cash-strapped transit agency says it took a $57 million hit in the first three months of 2022 from lost fares on buses. Last week, the MTA unveiled plans to spend $10 million a year to add 77 inspectors on local buses to its currently 172-member “EAGLE Team,” a security unit that has traditionally checked for proof of payment on Select Bus Service routes, along with graffiti.

The MTA says that with full implementation of the OMNY fare payment system by 2024, the expanded EAGLE squad — which stands for Evasion And Graffiti Lawlessness Eradication — will be able to have inspectors validate payment on local bus routes and not only at the start of trips.

But MTA board member David Jones, who serves on the agency’s new “Fareness” panel that is studying ways to reduce fare evasion, doesn’t believe the additional bodies will be enough to address the depth of the problem.

“The EAGLE Team, even augmented, is very small,” he told THE CITY. “I don’t think they’re going to be able to cope with the numbers.”

Data from automated sensors that count the number of riders boarding buses shows over 40% fares on Staten Island buses were not collected from April through June, compared with about 30% fare evasion on Manhattan and Brooklyn buses and 15% on Queens routes.

Bronx Keeps Evading It

Nowhere is fare evasion more pronounced than in The Bronx, where THE CITY spotted riders on multiple bus routes entering through back doors and walking past drivers without paying.

“I get it, because many people don’t have money to pay the fare,” said Destiny Destra, 26, who was waiting for a bus on Third Avenue. “It hurts the MTA, but for us, [the fare] is a lot.”

On one Bx15 along Third Avenue Tuesday, five riders paid their fares at the front of the bus, while six did not. On a Bx19 along 149th Street, nine riders boarded the bus through the rear, while none entered at the front.

Transport Workers Union Local 100, which represents bus operators, says drivers face an increased risk of being assaulted if they try to enforce the fare.

“Routes with the highest incidents of fare evasion tend to have the highest incidents, assaults and abuse inflicted on operators,” Tony Utano, the president of TWU Local 100 told THE CITY. “A much greater police presence on buses, riding across precinct boundaries , would be a good start towards reducing assaults, which is our main concern.”

MTA assault and harassment data shows bus workers typically face abuse at a higher rate than subway workers. For the week beginning July 18, the MTA counted 28 cases of harassment against bus operators, compared with two in the subway. The previous week, it tallied 38 cases of harassment and three assaults against bus operators.

Some riders said the outrage and fare evasion stems from frustration over service.

“The service is so bad that people feel entitled to ride for free,” said Clara Gonzalez, 67, who was waiting for a Bx32 bus after her weekly visit to Lincoln Medical Center on East 149th Street. “When people see the bus doesn’t come quickly enough, they just ride for free.”

Free for All

In March 2020, the MTA suspended fare collection on local bus routes and allowed riders to enter buses through rear doors in an effort to protect drivers from being exposed to COVID-19.

The free rides officially ended in late August 2020, while the MTA’s ridership, paying and not, is hovering around 60% of what it was prior to the pandemic.

Janno Lieber, the transit agency’s chairperson and CEO, has repeatedly said that riders who pay their fares tell the MTA that they feel “like they’re suckers” when other riders beat the fare on buses and trains.

And in the MTA’s latest round of financial uncertainty, concerns over missed revenue have surfaced again. The new efforts to curb fare evasion on buses and trains come as the MTA faces massive budget shortfalls, with the agency on pace to burn through billions in federal COVID relief funds earlier than projected, because ridership has not returned as forecast.

The $57 million loss to bus fare evasion in the first quarter of the year followed a $56 million loss in the last three months of 2021, according to the MTA. Those losses were the highest since April through June of 2019, when fare dodgers beat the transit agency for $60 million — although ridership was significantly higher.

Patrick Warren, the agency’s chief safety and security officer, said the MTA is looking to its “blue-ribbon panel” of civic, education and law enforcement leaders to address “the full range of factors contributing to fare evasion, and devising a menu of solutions.”

“In the meantime, MTAPD officers are prioritizing bus routes and stops experiencing the highest evasion rates, while the number of New York City Transit EAGLE team inspectors is substantially increasing to encourage riders to pay their fares,” he said in a statement to THE CITY.

Jones, the board member, suggested the MTA could cut into fare evasion by expanding the city’s “Fair Fares” program, which offers half-priced MetroCards to low-income New Yorkers.

More than 269,000 people have enrolled in the program, according to the Human Resources Administration, but Jones noted that figure is underwhelming.

“We think the number should be doubled in terms of people that should be eligible,” he said, citing calls from the MTA for the city to expand eligibility for the discounted-fares program, which requires participants to be at or below the federal poverty level.

Kate Slevin, another member of the “Fareness” panel, told THE CITY that the group hopes to deliver “useful guidance” to the MTA on how to reduce fare evasion.

“You don’t just want a strategy to be heavy on enforcement,” said Slevin, an executive vice president with the nonprofit Regional Plan Association. “You want to address the root causes.”",https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/08/02/fare-evasion-bronx-mta-eagle-team/
"Brooklyn train shooting: Officer, bystanders, suspect shot by NYPD in effort to subdue fare evader",2024-09-16 14:15:00+00:00,"NEW YORK -- A confrontation with a man skipping subway fare ended with a police officer, the suspect and two innocent bystanders shot in New York City.

It happened shortly after 3 p.m. Sunday. Two officers were on duty at an L Train platform in Brooklyn.

It started at the entrance, when, police say, the two officers assigned to transit detail followed a 37-year-old man up the stairs who hadn't paid his fare.

""The officers are asking him to stop. The male is refusing to stop at a certain point on the platform. The male, he mutters the words, 'I'm going to kill you if you don't stop following me,'"" NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said.

That verbal threat would become a physical one as the suspect pulled a knife from his pocket.

""They give numerous commands. The male basically challenges the officers, 'No, you're going to have to shoot me,'"" Maddrey said.

The confrontation moved inside a train that had just pulled into the station, and that's where police did open fire, after using a Taser on the suspect didn't work.

Dan Krauth has the details.

The bullets that flew inside the car and onto the platform struck the suspect and two passengers - a 26-year-old woman and a 49-year-old man - as well as a 40-year-old officer.

The officer was rushed to a nearby hospital, where the mayor and new interim police commissioner paid him a visit. They blamed the knife-wielding suspect they called a ""career criminal,"" with more than 20 arrests.

""Make no mistake, the events that occurred on the Sutter Avenue Station platform with the results of an armed perpetrator who was confronted by officers doing the job we asked them to do,"" interim NYPD Commissioner Thomas Donlon said.

The 37-year-old suspect was critically injured and is hospitalized.

The 49-year-old passenger was shot in the head during the incident and remains in critical condition.

A 26-year-old woman was grazed by a bullet and remained hospitalized early Monday.

Donlon said this is what the NYPD and MTA have been asking officers to do - to stop the fare evasion that is costing billions of dollars.

Detectives from the department's Force Investigation Division are going through video to determine the trajectory of those bullets. It is possible that the round that struck the officer was his own and ricocheted off the inside of the train.

The officer has been with the NYPD for 10 years, and is expected to recover.

NYPD to start patrolling bus routes with MTA fare enforcers,2023-08-03 00:00:00,"Next month, the NYPD will start patrolling some bus routes to help the MTA’s fare enforcement team get riders to pay their fares.

According to the MTA, it lost $315 million last year to fare evasion.

“Buses have become the number one fare evasion problem,” MTA Chairman Janno Lieber said.

The enforcement will also target routes in Kips Bay, Manhattan; Downtown Brooklyn and the ferry terminal on Staten Island

MTA officials say it’s only getting worse, with roughly one in three bus riders skipping the fare.

“That money could be used to run more buses,” Lieber said.

The MTA will deploy to local bus routes its Eagle Team, which is made up of unarmed security personnel who check fare stubs for people on the select bus service routes.

“It will be about reorienting our customers that paying their fare is expected and there are programs available to them as well, if they have a certain income level,” NYC Transit President Rich Davey said.

The NYPD is creating a unit dedicated to patrolling buses with MTA’s Eagle Team.

“A uniformed police presence at our subway turnstile adds to riders confidence and soon the same can be said for our city’s buses,” NYPD Transit Bureau Chief Michael Kemper said.

Union officials say they have been calling for police officers to pay attention to buses — arguing that bus routes with a lot of fare evasion have more cases of bus drivers being harassed and assaulted.

The Transport Workers Union says this year through June, there have been more than 700 bus operators who have been harassed, threatened, assaulted and spat on.

Before the crackdown on bus fare evasion starts in mid-September, there will be an education campaign, with members of the Eagle Team handling out pamphlets about discounted fare programs and why it’s important to pay the fare.

Nearly half of fare beaters caught this year have had active warrants,2023-07-22 00:00:00,"Nearly half of NYC fare-evaders arrested this year had open warrants for other crimes — including at least one accused killer.

Of the 2,502 people cuffed for fare beating this year, 1,136 — or just over 45% — were already being sought for arrest when they tried to hitch a free ride on the city’s transit system, according to disturbing new NYPD data obtained by The Post.

NYPD Transit Chief Michael Kemper told the MTA Board Monday that fare-beaters nabbed this year also had warrants for weapon possession, felony assault, and drugs.

Many fare-beaters also came strapped — with more than 200 caught carrying deadly weapons, including 13 guns and over 200 knives, Kemper told the MTA Board.

“The people in the system committing crimes are not lining up to get a MetroCard,” said Eugene O’Donnell, a John Jay College of Criminal Justice prof and a former cop and prosecutor. “They’re accessing the system almost invariably by not paying.

5 Claude White, who was wanted for murder, was arrested after cops spotted him fare beating. Steven Hirsch

“The old idea was that routinely fare evasion [enforcement] was a way to ferret out more serious misconduct,” O’Donnell said. “People were caught with guns, people were caught with warrants, people were caught who had just committed crimes who were in hot flight from those crimes, hopping the turnstiles.”

The shocking numbers come a month after Claude White, a homeless man accused of fatally stabbing Tavon Silver to death last month on a southbound 4 train, was charged — days later after he was caught trying to skip out on a subway fare in Harlem wearing blood-stained pants, cops said.

White, 33, was squabbling with Silver, 32, over drugs, then grabbed a steak knife Silver had on him, and plunged it twice into his chest, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said this week. White then tossed the knife into the subway tunnel, threw his shirt in the trash, and fled the 23rd Street station, Bragg said.

White, who had been on parole and was wanted in connection with a bank robbery on June 6, now faces murder and weapon charges.

In another case, evading a bus fare led cops to collar an alleged serial subway slasher.

Kemal Rideout allegedly stabbed three women at random — two at the 86th Street and Lexington Avenue station and a third on a southbound 4 train near the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station on June 19.

5 Kemal Rideout was arrested after attempting to skip out on paying for an MTA bus ride. DCPI

Similar to White, Rideout also had a long rap sheet including attempted rape, assault, and criminal mischief charges.

Not only were both White and Rideout, 28, arrested after fare beating — they were also nabbed by the same four officers.

“A decision was made to infuse more cops into the subway” following the pair of arrests, Kemper said at the time.

However, increased police enforcement on the subway will have little effect if there are no consequences for those who break the law, experts said.

“Once the bad guys know cops are looking at these things and they’re going to lock people up for jumping the turnstile, then it will deter people” Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said. “But if you’re not going to prosecute . . . it doesn’t mean anything.”

5 The MTA has been quietly implementing surveillance technology in some stations.

“The police should do it no matter what the DA is going to do because you’re going to get guns off the street, knives off the street, you’re going to keep riders safe,” he added.

Meanwhile, the MTA has been quietly implementing surveillance technology in some stations, using artificial intelligence to spot fare-beaters, according to an MTA report published in May. The system is meant to collect fare beating data and does not notify police in real time of fare evaders.

The MTA, which lost more than $500 million to fare evasion last year, is cracking down on fare-beaters on buses and replacing the locks on more than 1,600 subway tunnel emergency gates, according to the agency’s latest monthly Key Performance Metrics report released this week.

Turnstiles across the city are also expected to be modified over the next two years to prevent “back-cocking,” which is when fare-evaders pull the turnstile back enabling them to walk through without paying, a Transit official said Monday.

NEW YORK (WABC) -- The MTA is using artificial intelligence to help monitor fare evasion in several subway stations across New York City.

The agency's May report, which was published online by the MTA, confirms that AI was used at seven stations across the city in May to track unpaid entries. Officials are using that data to compare the figures to paid fares.

According to the report, more than 50% of subway evasion consists of people walking in through the emergency gate.

That figure is followed by 20% that jump or climb over the turnstile, 16% of those that slip through the gaps and 12% that duck under the turnstile.

The report says the largest spike of evasions typically takes place between 3 and 4 p.m., with smaller spikes occurring during the morning rush.

The agency estimates it lost $690 million to fare evasions last year.

The MTA expects the surveillance technology to be ""expanded this year to approximately two dozen more stations,"" according to the report.

This report comes after the MTA Board approved subway and bus fare hikes on Wednesday, prompting the first increase since 2019 and the first in the base subway and base fare since 2015.

As part of the decision, subway and bus fares will increase from $2.75 to $2.90 on Aug. 20.

MTA piloting delays to subway emergency exits in latest effort to deter fare evasion,2024-01-29 16:45:24-05:00,"Straphangers walk out of an emergency exit at the 28th Street station at Park Avenue on the Nos. 4 and 6 subway lines in Manhattan.

Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

Subway emergency exit gates at select stops will open on a delay as part of an MTA pilot program aimed at deterring the use of what officials call “the superhighway of fare evasion.”

The pilot program will implement a 15-second delay for egress through emergency exit gates at 3rd Avenue-138th Street (6) in the Bronx, Flushing Avenue (J/M) in Brooklyn, and 59th Street-Lexington Avenue (4/5/6/N/R/W) in Manhattan. MTA construction chief Jamie Torres-Springer said the pilot will be implemented “in the near future.”

“By introducing the delayed egress, we maintain the emergency exit capacity while making it more difficult to open it on a regular basis,” Torres-Springer said at the MTA’s Capital Program Committee meeting on Jan. 29.

Fare evasion cost the MTA nearly $700 million in lost revenue in 2022, a number that may prove even higher in 2023, and the agency is undertaking a slew of initiatives to prevent it. Those include deploying more cops and deploying private security guards to fare arrays, as well as seeking proposals from the private sector for redesigning turnstiles.

But the emergency exit gate is one of the most porous entrances to the subway system. When a passenger departing a station pushes open the exit gate, a window is created that often allows other riders to enter for free, many of whom might have otherwise paid the fare, hence why officials deem it the “superhighway” for farebeaters.

“We know that the exit gates have become a significant source of fare evasion,” said Torres-Springer. “Because whether someone is using them appropriately or inappropriately, they can be held open for people to stream through.”

The MTA sought and received a waiver from the New York Department of State’s code enforcement division to allow for the pilot to proceed. Torres-Springer said that the state was satisfied that, based on conditions at the three stations, emergency evacuations could safely occur even with the 15-second delay.

Should there be an emergency, officials say those stations have enough other “means of egress” to evacuate. An MTA spokesperson noted that the pilot stations are often staffed with personnel near the fare arrays, but noted that state code authorities were satisfied that the delay would not jeopardize the “health, safety, and security” of passengers, as in emergencies there are other ways to evacuate stations.

The MTA spokesperson also said that staffers can override the 15-second delay in the event of an emergency.

A spokesperson for the Department of State said that the MTA had requested a variance from the state’s Uniform Fire & Building Code. The regulator determined the change would still achieve the objective of the fire code and wouldn’t jeopardize health, safety, or security.

Emergency exits are also used by some riders with disabilities or who are pushing strollers, or others who can’t cross the traditional turnstiles. For those riders, the agency has deployed “wide-aisle” turnstiles at two stops — Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center in Brooklyn and Sutphin Boulevard-Archer Avenue in Queens — though it’s unclear when they’ll be expanded further in the system.

At Sutphin-Archer, the MTA is also testing normal-size turnstiles that open middle-out instead of twirling, although a TikTok user discovered a hack that can open the $700,000 gates with just a movement of the hand.",https://www.amny.com/transit/mta-delays-subway-emergency-exits-fare-evasion/
New York has to combat fare evasion,2024-04-16 00:00:00,Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window),https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/04/16/new-york-has-to-combat-fare-evasion/
"MTA’s new fare evasion tactic, subway emergency gates open after 15 seconds",2024-02-20 14:00:19+00:00,"In response to escalating fare evasion in NYC subway stations, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has initiated several pilot programs over recent years. In a recent attempt to address this persistent issue, the MTA implemented a 15-second delay on emergency doors at select subway stations after payment. This delay aims to deter individuals from exploiting emergency exits to evade the $2.90 subway fare, safeguarding the MTA’s revenue and ensuring a fair system for all commuters.

Fare evasion reached 12.7% in 2023, resulting in a staggering loss of approximately $409 million in revenue, ABC 7 NY reported. Instances of individuals bypassing turnstiles or utilizing emergency exits without payment have become increasingly prevalent, posing significant challenges to the MTA’s revenue streams.

The MTA’s newest pilot initiative arrived as the transportation giant recently unveiled a new program to decrease fare evasion by installing new turnstile gates at subway stations. But New Yorkers quickly adapted, sharing workaround methods on social media platforms.

While the implementation of delays at emergency exits may initially raise concerns regarding their primary purpose of providing swift egress during emergencies, it’s essential to note that these measures are being piloted selectively. The MTA has carefully chosen stations with ample turnstile access to ensure that, despite the delay, commuters can still exit efficiently and safely in the event of an emergency. The program has received approval for testing at key stations, including the 59th Street Lexington Avenue Station in Manhattan, The Flushing Avenue Station in Brooklyn and the 138th Avenue Station in the Bronx.

Initial testing at Borough Hall Station in Brooklyn revealed instances of rider frustration, with individuals attempting to force open barred exits or circumvent turnstiles out of impatience. NYC Transit President Richard Davey stated that riders would grow frustrated as the door did not open immediately, causing them to make their way toward the turnstiles. Despite being tested at only one station thus far, it appears the MTA may have identified a viable solution to deter fare evasion on the subway. New Yorkers, renowned for their impatience, may find the delay tactic effective in curbing evasion, potentially leading to its wider implementation across the subway network.

However, concerns arise regarding the feasibility of implementing such delays citywide. Smaller stations like the 23rd Street station near Baruch College, with limited emergency exits may not justify the same delay measures. The MTA faces the challenge of balancing effective evasion deterrence with operational efficiency across diverse station layouts to ensure that all commuters can travel safely and affordably.

While the MTA explores innovative solutions to combat fare evasion, such efforts come with considerable costs. Yet, the simplest solution might lie in lowering subway fares. High fares inadvertently incentivize evasion, making fare reduction a long-term strategy to address the issue effectively. Commuters, like those at Baruch, who spend approximately $6 daily on public transit, would benefit from more affordable fares, potentially reducing the motivation to evade payment.",https://theticker.org/13305/news/mtas-new-fare-evasion-tactic-subway-emergency-gates-open-after-15-seconds/
MTA grasps at solution after ‘hack’ against heavily-mocked subway fare gates goes viral,2024-01-31 00:00:00,"The chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority defended its much-mocked new subway gates and emergency-exit timers as the authority estimates losing $690 million to fare jumpers.

Chairman Janno Lieber admitted Wednesday that the easily opened $700,000 gates the MTA tested at the Sutphin Boulevard-Archer Avenue station weren’t fool-proof.

“We might, in retrospect, have chosen a different model,” Lieber said.

.”We’re going to to continue to experiment, this is not what we’re putting in, in the whole system and it’s being adjusted to deal with some of its shortcomings.”

He argued the gates were a partial success, with fare collection at the station having jumped 20 percent since they were installed.

He also knocked critics of the subway’s new 15-second timers that aim to discourage straphangers from using the emergency doors to leave the station.

Officials believe that reducing the number of times the emergency doors are opened will reduce the number of chances for fare cheats to sneak in without paying — but lefty political activists and commentators online have compared the changes to the decisions made by the sweatshop owners of the Triangle Waistshirt Factory.

That led to the deadliest infernos in city history and subsequent efforts to impose worker safety regulations in the early 1900s.

“It’s not funny and it’s not relevant, you’re making light of a tragedy in New York’s history,” a visibly irritated Lieber told reporters.

“We’ve gotten approval from the code authorities, the fire experts on how to do it, and we’re gonna do it,” he continued, “because we’re not letting New Yorkers who walk up to the turnstile and pay their fare — and look over at somebody who has their Metrocard in their hand or their OMNY open on their phone decide that they’re going to go for the gate because it’s open.”

MTA officials have long pursued sign-offs from state safety regulators to begin testing the timed emergency gates near the turnstiles.

They will be installed at three stations as part of the pilot: 59th-Lexington Avenue (No. 4,5 and 6), 138-Grand Concourse in The Bronx (4/5) and Flushing Avenue (J/M) stop on the Bushwick-South Williamsburg border in Brooklyn.

The modified doors will have signs that inform riders of the timers.

Officials also said Wednesday that the motorized doors equipped with fare readers at wheelchair-accessible subway stations — known as AutoGates — will not have timers installed.

The timers are one of a slew of shorter-term efforts the agency is pursuing to clamp down on fare evasion, which soared post-pandemic.

Just 3 percent of riders hopped the turnstile in the first quarter of 2018: a number that tripled to 12.5 percent in the first quarter of 2022 and rose again to 13.3 percent during the last quarter of 2023.

The problem is even worse on the city bus system, where nearly half of riders board without paying, stats show.

Exact figures for the amount lost to fare-beating in 2023 have not yet been released, but Lieber said the toll would likely be higher than the $690 million in 2022.

The growing toll put the agency’s finances under strain and, officials argue, contributed to drop-offs that riders reported in feeling safe underground.

Officials have announced that they are installing tighter gearing on turnstiles to stop riders from being able to wiggle through and the MTA has installed new locks on the emergency doors in the stations after discovering that copies of the old master keys had become widely available. Officials also hired private security guards to stand near the emergency exits at stations to discourage people from sneaking in.

Ultimately, the MTA officials believe — and transit advocates largely agree — that a redesign of the subway system’s fare gates is necessary to fix the problem.

Fare gates commonly used in Europe feature tall plastic doors that are much more difficult to jump or squeeze through. The doors close quickly to prevent people skipping fares from trailing in behind paying riders, but the mechanism is designed to stay open longer for those with wheelchairs, strollers or riders in wheelchairs.

However, New York’s first attempt at using an imported gate setup was quickly hacked by a social media star who showed in a widely shared video how they could be defeated just by leaning over and waving at an ill-placed sensor, which would open the doors.

Those proposals are due back on Feb. 29.",https://nypost.com/2024/01/31/metro/mta-grasps-at-solution-after-hack-against-heavily-mocked-subway-fare-gates-goes-viral/
MTA to begin crackdown on bus fare evasion this fall; program will launch on S.I. next week,2023-08-05 19:26:34.998000+00:00,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has announced it will begin a bus fare evasion crackdown this fall — deploying Evasion and Graffiti Lawlessness Eradication (EAGLE) teams to bus stop hubs throughout the city with high rates of fare evasion. The initiative, which is run by uniformed and unarmed MTA officers supported by the NYPD, is scheduled for a September launch, but will kick off along several troublesome routes next week – including 22 lines in Staten Island.

“This approach involves reorienting our customers, so they know that paying the fare is expected, while also educating them on programs that are available for reduced fares,” said New York City Transit President Richard Davey.

The MTA reports that it lost an estimated $315 million to fare evasion on buses in 2022. The agency says customers commonly evade fares by walking past the farebox without paying, boarding through a back door, short-changing the farebox, or failing to purchase a ticket for Select Bus Service (SBS).

The goals of the Bus Stop Hub approach are “to improve customer awareness of opportunities to pay lower fares, raise visibility and improve equity of fare evasion inspection on buses in all five boroughs,” a press release about the initiative notes.

EAGLE Team inspectors are charged with inspecting fares on local and SBS bus routes. The Authority is also partnering with the NYPD to ensure safety of EAGLE Team staff, a move which the agency claims has resulted in a decrease in bus operator assaults.

The Bus Stop Hub approach launched in Downtown Brooklyn on July 31 and will continue to branch out to the following locations in the next two weeks:

Monday, August 7: Staten Island Ferry

22 Bus Routes: S40, S42, S44, S46, S48, S51, S52, S61, S62, S66, S74, S76, S78, S81, S84, S86, S90, S91, S92, S94, S96, S98

Monday, August 14: Kips Bay along 34 St, 1 Av, 2 Av, and 3 Av

25 Bus Routes: BM5, BXM1, M101, M102, M103, M15, M34, M34A, M9, QM1, QM10, QM12, QM15, QM16, QM17, QM18, QM2, QM20, QM24, QM3, QM4, QM5, QM6, SBS15, X68

Enforcement will spread throughout the rest of the city in September.

“The hundreds of millions of dollars the MTA loses to fare evasion every year could be used to reinvest into the transit system in the form of more service that’s instead totally lost. It’s not fair to the millions of riders who do the right thing and swipe or tap in every day,” said MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber in a statement.

A pilot program that allowed New Yorkers to ride for free is ending.

NEW YORK (WABC) -- An MTA pilot program that allowed commuters to ride for free along some bus routes across the five boroughs ends on Sunday.

Several bus routes are impacted, including the B60, BX18, M116, Q4, S46 and S96.

The program, which New York State funded, expires Sept. 1.

The impact the free rides had on commuters was noticeable. The MTA says ridership along the routes with free service increased by 35 percent during the pilot program.

The end of free rides comes as the agency begins to crack down on bus fare evaders. The MTA, in concert with the NYPD, has deployed agents to monitor bus routes with high evasion rates and are issuing summonses to offenders.

The agency says it loses hundreds of millions of dollars each year from people who don't pay their bus fares, which amounts to almost half of bus riders.

Police are still searching for the attacker in the Washington Heights subway stabbing.

MTA CEO touts anti-fare evasion plan to curb violent subway crime,2022-04-26 00:00:00,"The head of the MTA on Tuesday promised to tackle soaring subway crime partly by setting up a review panel to figure out how to curb fare evasion — two weeks to the day after a mass shooting on a Brooklyn train.

Agency leaders have been focusing on fare-beating as an anti-crime strategy since at least 2018 — including since the COVID-19 pandemic, when subway-system evasions have doubled.

“Fare evasion tears at our social fabric,” said MTA CEO Janno Lieber, speaking in Manhattan at a gathering of business hosted by the Association for a Better New York. “People who commit robberies and violent crimes generally don’t bother with MetroCard swipes or OMNY [contactless] taps.”

Lieber said he would form a “panel of distinguished New Yorkers” to come up with enforcement, infrastructure and education-based strategies to increase fare compliance.

“What we want, all of us, is to deter crime before it happens by keeping the bad actors out of the system in the first place,” Lieber said.

After the event, the MTA chief praised Mayor Eric Adams and NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell for increasing the NYPD’s presence patrolling trains, platforms and turnstiles — and called on them not to relent.

“Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Commissioner Sewell. We may need those cops, that surge, that increase in police presence in numbers, to continue for some time,” Lieber told reporters.

“Because to give people comfort, sense of safety and to achieve safety, it may be we need more cops to be on the platforms, on the train and in all parts of the station.”

4 Farebeating rates currently stand at over 30 percent on buses and 12 percent on subways, according to Lieber. Christopher Sadowski

Lieber’s comments came after alleged madman Frank James fired shots into a crowded Brooklyn subway car during morning rush hour April 13, striking 10 people with bullets and leaving another 19 injured in the mayhem.

The rate of underground crimes per rider also remains stubbornly above pre-COVID levels, despite being down overall because of lower ridership. Meanwhile, felony assaults in the system specifically are surging — and last month reached their highest total since the NYPD began increasing its transit presence last May. The year 2021 marked the highest number of felony assaults reported by NYPD on the subways in at least 25 years.

Farebeating rates currently stand at over 30 percent on buses and 12 percent on subways, Lieber said — the latter a two-fold increase compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic.

As a result, the MTA is on track to lose more than $500 million this year to turnstile jumpers and bus fare evaders, according to authority estimates.

Lieber, an appointee of Gov. Kathy Hochul, acknowledged that farebeating is “engaged in across all demographics” but insisted that tackling the problem would also positively impact public safety.

A report last year by state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli’s office dinged the authority for spending $24 million per year on a crackdown pushed by ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, only to see evasion rates increase.

"MTA losing $119M and counting to fare evasion, officials say",2022-05-22 00:00:00,"Soaring fare evasion on subways and buses cost the MTA $119 million in the first three months of the year, according to new statistics — and officials want transit workers to help them rein in the costly problem.

A memo sent to city bus drivers on Friday urged them to “politely state the fare” to passengers trying to ride without paying.

Fare-beaters account for 31.5% of all bus riders, according to figures released ahead of the MTA’s board meetings this week — up from 29.3% during the last three months of 2021.

Subway fare evasion is also on the rise, with 9.8% of riders skipping the fee at the end of 2021, to 12.5% in the most recent survey.

Overall, the MTA claims to have lost $62 million on subways and $57 million on buses to fare-beating. That’s on track for nearly half a billion dollars in losses for the year.

The rising fare-beating rates have been accompanied by an 18.3% increase in NYPD “enforcement actions,” according MTA documents.

MTA CEO Janno Lieber declared war on fare evasion earlier this month, promising a “blue ribbon panel” would come up with ways to combat the issue — including possible new turnstile designs, an education campaign and increased enforcement.

Subway workers have also been deputized to assist with fare enforcement, and been given instructions on how to count turnstile jumpers, according to a source.

Bus drivers for their part resent — and fear — the MTA asking them to play a role in fare collection, some 13-plus years after Brooklyn driver Edwin Thomas was fatally stabbed over a bus transfer.

“Edwin Thomas is still remembered quite clearly,” said Transport Workers Union Local 100 Vice President J.P. Patafio.

“The operator’s job isn’t to collect fares,” Patafio said. “It’s to drive people safely from one point to another.”",https://nypost.com/2022/05/22/mta-losing-119m-and-counting-to-fare-evasion-officials-say/
MTA attendant at a Brooklyn subway station is using this method to punish fare evaders,2024-04-20 00:00:00,"He’s every turnstile jumper’s worst nightmare.

An MTA ticket booth attendant at a Brooklyn subway station wants to see brazen scofflaws punished for evading fares – so he announces them over the loud speaker.

He hopes his public address announcements — in which he describes each evader — gets the attention of cops patrolling the station.

3 A New Yorker named Trevona brought posted a TikTok video titled “So MTA workers are announcing fare evaders now” on April 14.

“So I’m at the L train at Jefferson Street and why the guy in the booth is literally announcing people who are hopping the turnstile, and he’s like, ‘Girl in the green jacket, two girls coming down the stairs,’” a New Yorker named Trevona says in the beginning of an April 14 TikTok video titled “So MTA workers are announcing fare evaders now.”

Suddenly, the MTA employee’s voice is heard booming over the intercom: “MTA police officers … coming down the stairs, green jacket, blue jeans, fare evader!”

Then Trevona pans the camera to show two uniformed NYPD officers across the tracks, backs and feet liesurely leaning on the wall, seemingly unmoved by announcement.

One cop has his hands in his pockets, while the other appears to be on his cell phone.

“I thought [the police] was gonna run over but they laughing at [poop emoji] on they phone,” Trevona observes in the comments section of the 30-second video, which has amassed more than 80,000 views.

In response to the TikTok, an NYPD spokesperson said that police must observe violations of transit rules in order to address the perpetrator.

“There is no set cross-agency protocol for announcing observed fare evaders” between the MTA and NYPD, the spokesperson added.

“Station agents work closely with the NYPD, serving as eyes and ears to help improve overall rider experience,” MTA spokesperson Kayla Shults told The Post when asked about the attendant’s fare-enforcement strategy.",https://nypost.com/2024/04/20/us-news/mta-attendant-at-a-brooklyn-subway-station-is-using-this-method-to-punish-fare-evaders/
MTA uses armed guards in subways to stop fare evaders,2022-11-29 00:00:00,"The MTA is sending armed guards into the subways to stop fare-beating — and says the move is already saving it money.

The transit agency contracted a private security firm to provide the armed personnel at the Myrtle-Wyckoff station on the Brooklyn-Queens border since before summer, officials revealed Tuesday.

The transit agency is now netting about $100,000 a month in additional revenues thanks to the mere presence of the guards, who just stand by the vending machines and don’t make arrests, MTA safety official Robert Diehl told authority board members at a meeting.

Armed guards have since been placed in the nearby Halsey Street station in Brooklyn, too, officials said.

The agency also decided to use unarmed guards to block emergency exits and try to prevent scofflaws at 12 other stations, officials said.

“We actually started with armed guards first at the [fare] machines. Later, after discussion, we decided, let’s introduce some unarmed guards at the gates,” Diehl said.

“Once that gate is open, it’s like Black Friday at Macy’s,” Diehl said of subway entrances. “Holding that gate is imperative to stopping half the amount of fare evasion in our stations.

“What we’re really trying to stop is the opportunists, that person that once the gates open sees three people go through and says, ‘Hey, why not me?’ and then you got eight people behind that person coming through.”

The presence of the guards is meant to “deter” riders from entering through the exit gate, and prevent vandalism of vending machines, which had been a persistent problem at the Myrtle-Wyckoff station in particular, Diehl said.

It’s unclear if more private armed security will be hired for other stations, but the MTA is at least expanding its unarmed guards to other stops, officials said.

NYPD fare enforcement is also up, with arrests jumping 97% this year compared to last, NYPD Transit Bureau Chief Jason Wilcox said Tuesday.

MTA CEO Janno Lieber has claimed that transit criminals are “overwhelmingly” fare-beaters, although he has yet to provide statistics to back that up.

As of May, the MTA estimated it was on track to lose $500 million to fare evasion this year.

Officials do not expect to recoup every cent from their anti-fare-beating efforts, MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey said Tuesday.",https://nypost.com/2022/11/29/mta-uses-armed-guards-in-subways-to-stop-fare-evaders/

Once he was cuffed, Louis told police he was an MTA employee, sources told The Post.

Single NY subway fare-dodger has 200 busts: cops,2024-03-22 00:00:00,"It took six undercover cops 15 minutes to restrain a single fare-dodger at New York’s busiest station — a scene that illustrates just how difficult it is to tackle the MTA’s crisis.

The Post watched at the Times Square station as the man refused to provide ID and yelled, “Bruh! Bruh! You can’t do this to me, no!” in front of commuters — then dropped to his knees, forcing cops to cuff him and finally drag him to the precinct as he continued shouting.

The suspect turned out to have a bench warrant for criminal possession of stolen property and behaved so erratically that cops sent him to Bellevue Hospital for observation.

And in the 15 minutes it took the entire squad to deal with him, The Post watched fare-beater after fare-beater jump the turnstile or walk through the open emergency door at just one entrance in the Times Square station.

The spectacle came hours before one subway fare-beater blasted two NYPD cops with Mace at the East 116th Street station.

The arrest was part of a two-hour deployment watched by The Post at Times Square of NYPD plainclothes transit cops, who issued 10 summonses and made three arrests for theft of service — part of a crackdown on fare-beaters designed to root out violent criminals and repeat offenders.

“I wish we could stop everyone but we can’t, but we conduct these targeted operations at stations where we’re having complaints or we’re having high crime to get the recidivists off the street, even just for a day,” Inspector Jonathan Bobin, commanding officer of the Transit Bureau’s Special Operations Division, told The Post.

9 The arrest in Times Square turned from an attempt to write a summons — a fine of $50 or $100 — to an arrest when the man refused to show ID, then became increasingly uncooperative. Stefano Giovannini

“When you’re a paying customer, you see other people not paying. It’s one of several things that can lead to a sense of disorder and subway system.”

The Post has learned that the subway’s most prolific criminal currently is Eric Harvey.

He was the biggest transit offender of last year and has racked up more than 200 busts in his lifetime — all of them for tampering with MetroCard vending machines or for selling swipes for cash.

But the most recent MTA data show that fare-beating in the subway and on buses cost straphangers an eye-watering $690 million last year.

An estimated 14% of subway riders jumped the turnstiles between July and September last year — the highest level recorded in the five years of MTA data published online.

And 41% of bus riders commuted without paying during the third quarter of 2023.

Bobin said his teams make thousands of arrests and issue thousands of summons to some of the worst subway cheats every year.

The fare-beater evasion squad issues fines between $50 to $100 for skipping out on the $2.90 fare.

They wear bodycams under their jackets and flash their shields to many of those they apprehend who don’t believe they are cops.

“The goal is not necessarily making arrests, it’s to correct behavior,” Bobin said.

In fact, two different sets of tourists, one group Haitian and one French, who seemed confused by their surroundings were allowed to go on their way by the transit cops after they determined they hadn’t deliberately come through the emergency gate without paying.

“We’re out here and we’re doing our job and we’re stopping large numbers of people,” Sgt. Fernando Cordero, who was heading one of the units Tuesday, told The Post.

“It may seem like we’re up against big odds but we’re here, we’re a real presence and the average person who gets caught is usually too embarrassed to do it again.”

The link between far evasion and crime was dramatically highlighted last week when Dajuan Robinson, 36, first went through the emergency gate at Nostrand Avenue — then allegedly started a violent rush-hour fight on board an A train approaching Hoyt-Schermerhorn station in Brooklyn, which ended with him being shot with his own gun.

Two of the undercover transit team officers in Tuesday’s Times Square deployment were at the station when the incident unfolded — and one had to give Robinson CPR.

“It was a crazy situation, no doubt about it,” the officer told The Post. “I hadn’t quite seen anything like that, but it’s the type of thing we face every day.”

But when it comes to the 1,200 specialized transit cops, officers say it’s just not a fair fight as they try to stop fare-beating at 472 stations on the city’s 24 lines.

Transit cops are being boosted by 1,000 regular NYPD officers in a “policing surge” at the busiest times, while Gov. Kathy Hochul ordered 1,000 more state troopers, National Guard members and MTA officers — who usually patrol the Metro North and LIRR networks — to carry out bag checks on the subway.

But the cop presence is still a “drop in the bucket,” a source familiar with subway policing told The Post.

“They just aren’t going to be able to patrol a system that big to any real degree of satisfaction even with the surge policing,” the source said.

“As we saw last year, additional police presence in the subways drives crime down. But it is just not sustainable to rely on overtime to provide that presence,” said Patrick Hendry, president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, the union representing the city’s cops.

MTA’s Latest Effort on Fare Evasion Is Mostly Just Annoying,2022-05-09 17:37:34.715000+00:00,"Photo: Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images

Yelling “back door” while trying to get let off a New York City bus is now official policy. On Sunday, the New York Post reported that the MTA ordered bus operators to stop automatically opening the back door except in an emergency; if riders want to exit, they will now have to manually open the rear doors. An MTA spokesperson told the Post this was to crack down on fare evasion by making people board at the front, while claiming that it still “continues to offer customers easy exits.”

The thing about utilizing multiple bus doors — and the new OMNY readers that have been installed at them — is that they make it faster and easier to board and exit the bus, ultimately reducing delays and making the bus a more appealing transit option. One sign of this is the fact that the MTA is still allowing select buses to automatically open their rear doors, since riders buy their fares beforehand or through the OMNY readers. (All-door boarding and off-board fare collection cut dwell time by 40 percent on the B44.) But instead, the MTA has decided to make things more complicated for the rest of the bus system in its single-minded campaign against fare evasion.

J.P. Patafio, who represents bus operators as the vice-president of Transport Workers Union Local 100, told the Post that the memo was “silly” given that drivers rarely open the back door on their own anyway. Last month, MTA chairman Janno Lieber blamed latte-drinkers for fare evasion, then tried to inspire some kind of citywide resentment over the issue. “What hardworking, fare-paying New Yorkers tell us, in a word, is that seeing fare evasion makes them feel like suckers,” Lieber said. Now the suckers are the ones banging on the back door to get off the bus, I guess.",https://www.curbed.com/2022/05/mta-bus-fare-evasion-back-doors.html
MTA quietly rolls out AI at 7 unnamed stations to monitor fare evasion in NYC subways: report,2023-07-20 00:00:00,"The MTA has quietly rolled out artificial intelligence to monitor turnstile-jumping in more than a half-dozen subway stations, according to a new report.

The transit agency installed third-party technology designed by a Spanish company to help station controllers crack down on fare evasion at seven unnamed stations and plans to add it to two dozen more stations within the year “with more to follow,” according to NBC News and a transit report.

It’s unclear when the AI program was first put to use, but it was highlighted in the agency’s May report.

The MTA insisted the technology created by the company AWAAIT is not being used to send info on the fare evaders to the NYPD, but an agency spokesperson declined to comment if that will change when asked by NBC.

Instead, the transit authority said the AI is being used to monitor fare evasion incidents to collect data and observe trends.

“We’re using it essentially as a counting tool,” MTA Communications Director Tim Minton told the news station. “The objective is to determine how many people are evading the fare and how are they doing it.”

In a separate statement to The Post, Minton added: “The MTA uses this tool to quantify the amount of fare evasion without identifying fare evaders.”

The transit system has lost $690 million from unpaid fares since 2022.

The AI technology connects to the transit system’s expansive 10,000-camera surveillance system and records videos of the straphangers hopping turnstiles, walking in through emergency exit gates, entering subway stations two at a time and other methods of skipping the swipe.

A promotional video created by AWAAIT demonstrating the tech states that images of a fare dodger taken by the cameras can be automatically sent to the station manager’s phone within seconds.

Minton said the city’s videos are stored on the MTA’s servers “for a limited period,” according to NBC.

Still, privacy advocates told the outlet they worry the technology goes too far.

“This is a moment where movement around the city has never been more surveilled,” said Albert Fox Cahn, the director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a nonprofit legal group that advocates for privacy rights in the Big Apple.

3 The MTA is also evaluating replacing aging turnstiles with new, harder-to-bypass ones. James Messerschmidt for NY Post

A heavily-redacted July 2022 MTA contract obtained by Cahn through a Freedom of Information Law request and shared with the outlet reveals that the transit authority first tested the technology in NYC in 2020 and gradually expanded its use over 2021 and 2022.

The news of the AI program comes days before New Yorkers will have to fork up more cash to take the city’s subways and buses. The $2.75 fare will increase to $2.90 beginning on August 20 in its first price hike since 2015.

Critics have said the MTA’s enforcement against fare evasion is in effect criminalizing poverty.

“It’s really unfortunate that rather than thinking about how the city and state can be making these services more available, more accessible to the public, they’re spending all this time and money on enforcement mechanisms to try to get money from the lowest-income New Yorkers,” Legal Aid Society attorney Molly Griffard told NBC.

The MTA has spent at least $35,335 — and likely more — on the AI tech, according to available reports. The agency made two purchases for the “AWAAIT Video Analytics Fare Evasion Software” in 2021 at that price, according to GovSpend. The purchasing figures for 2022 weren’t in the government spending database, according to the outlet.

The transit authority is also spending more than $45 million a year to make subway turnstiles harder to climb over and slip past the gates in its effort to decrease the amount of fare evasion in the system. It’s also exploring replacing the aging turnstiles with new gates that are near impossible to hop over.

However, those efforts wouldn’t fix the most common way straphangers skip the trip fee. The MTA’s own AI technology on fare evasion found that more than half of fare evasion incidents consist of people walking into stations through the emergency exit gates.",https://nypost.com/2023/07/20/nyc-transit-secretly-using-ai-to-track-fare-evasion-in-subways-report/
"MTA debuts new turnstiles at Jamaica subway station designed to increase accessibility, hinder fare evasion – QNS",2023-12-06 12:30:22-05:00,"The MTA unveils a new turnstile system at the Sutphin Boulevard-Archer Avenue-JFK Airport subway station to improve accessibility while cutting down on fare evasion.

Sign up for our QNS email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

The MTA announced on Dec. 4 the installation of the first-ever wide-aisle fare gates and a new customer service center at the Sutphin Boulevard-Archer Avenue-JFK Airport subway station in Jamaica.

The first full replacement of traditional turnstiles in the subway system will improve accessibility for riders with wheelchairs, strollers and luggage while combating fare evasion at the station.

“I’m thrilled to see the MTA’s continued strides in creating better systems for New Yorkers, especially for the residents of Queens,” Council Member Nantasha Williams said. “The upcoming opening of the new Customer Service Center at Sutphin Boulevard – Archer Avenue – JFK AirTrain station and the innovative wide-aisle gates initiative will bring a significant improvement to the daily commute and overall transportation experience for Queens residents. These positive changes reflect a commitment to enhancing convenience and accessibility, making journeys smoother and more efficient. It’s exciting to witness these improvements that will undoubtedly benefit our city’s residents.”

State Sen. Leroy Comrie said the new wide-aisle gate installation at the station is a major step forward in accessibility.

“As a strong and vocal supporter of the MTA’s responsibility to make ADA improvements I am pleased to see the Sutphin Boulevard-Archer Avenue–JFK Airport station prioritize these concepts in their latest installments,” Comrie said. “This station connects to one of the busiest airports in the world and with thousands of travelers, residents and commuters passing through these gates every day, efficiency and ease of use must be delivered at the highest standard. I applaud the MTA on the completion of this project and look forward to its positive impact.”

In addition to the new gates, the MTA also installed four traditional turnstiles at the north end of the mezzanine to enhance customer flow.

“Modernizing our century-old subway system isn’t just a necessary investment structurally, it’s a critical move toward ensuring Queens commuters of any ability can easily and safely travel to any destination in the city. That’s exactly what today’s announcement entails,” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said. “Thank you to the MTA for its efforts to support Southeast Queens riders and strengthen one of our community’s most important transit hubs.”

Council Member James Gennaro applauded the agency for making the transit system more accessible.

“This transformative initiative not only improves the functionality of our transit system but also underscores the MTA’s pledge to make public transportation more inclusive, convenient and customer-centric,” Gennaro said.

The MTA also announced the opening of a new customer service center, making the station the 14th center in the subway system. The new center features new lighting and enhanced customer service functions such as station agents on hand to assist in converting riders to OMNY, signing up for reduced fare and helping troubleshoot general concerns.

“New York City Transit’s North Star is improving the customer experience and we are doing just that at Sutphin Boulevard by introducing new, easier to access, fare gates and by opening our 14th Customer Service Center,” NYC Transit President Richard Davey said. “Customers traveling to and from JFK with their luggage, commuters transferring from the LIRR at Jamaica and local commuters can look forward to faster, more accessible journeys and a more welcoming station environment.”

The new fare gates replace the emergency exit gate at the end of the station, which was a major contributor to subway fare evasion.

“This new generation of fare gates is critical not only to advancing accessibility but also preventing fare evasion, which threatens the financial well-being of our entire transit system,” said MTA Construction and Development President Jamie Torres-Springer. “More than half of all subway fare evasion occurs through emergency exit gates, and this redesign of our fare array infrastructure will eliminate this opportunity.”",https://qns.com/2023/12/mta-debuts-turnstiles-jamaica-subway-station/
LIRR's TrainTime app warns police are enforcing fare payments,2024-06-18 13:56:23.086000+00:00,"MTA officials are taking a new step toward making sure Long Island Rail Road riders know the potential consequences of skipping out on their fares.

Commuters opening the railroad’s TrainTime app on recent days were greeted with a photo of two cops and a stern warning about the consequences of fare evasion. The pop-up message reminds users that ""MTA Police are enforcing fare payment,"" and that riders who ""don't pay the fare and don't show valid ID will be removed from the train, issued a summons, or arrested.""

Users must click ""I acknowledge"" before using the app's regular features, including purchasing tickets and viewing schedules. About 310,000 people use TrainTime each weekday, including Metro-North customers.

Asked about the app message, Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman Aaron Donovan said that, following the recommendations last year from a panel of experts, ""the LIRR and MTA Police are strengthening fare evasion enforcement.""

At the LIRR's Mineola station Tuesday, commuters offered different takes on the message, with some praising the railroad and police for taking a tough stance on fare beaters, and others suggesting the warning, accompanied by a picture of uniformed cops sporting armor and handcuffs, was a tad much.

""It's a bit extreme, in my opinion … I feel like it's more of a scare tactic than them actually enforcing it with police,"" said Marcello DePaula, 24, of Williston Park, who sees passengers trying to skip out on paying ""pretty often.""

""Sometimes they walk out of the train and go a couple [cars] back when they see the conductor coming. They'll hide in the bathrooms,"" said DePaula, who was surprised by the pop-up message when he opened the app Monday morning.

Jenna Jacobs, of Port Jefferson, said she wasn't bothered by the image of police ""doing their job.""

""Showing a police officer shows that people need to follow the law,"" said Jacobs, 19, who also regularly witnesses fare evasion on the LIRR.

Gerard Bringmann, chairman of the LIRR Commuter Council, said while he expects some app users will interpret the message as MTA officials looking at them as ""a bunch of criminals,"" he thought it hit the right note.

“I like the imagery, because it sends a message that, ‘We’re serious about this.’ It’s created a buzz. People are talking about it, and that’s what you want, because you want to get that message out,"" said Bringmann, who supports increased police enforcement on the LIRR.

“It’s unfortunate it’s come to this, but we’ve reached a point where too many people are taking advantage, and you’ve got to draw a line in the sand,"" Bringmann added.

The new tactic comes as the MTA continues to deal with fare evasion, which costs the MTA about $700 million a year. LIRR conductors last year issued about 160,000 invoices to passengers who said they could not pay for their rides — up about 60% from the previous year, according to MTA data obtained by Newsday. The LIRR’s most persistent fare beater last year received 155 invoices within six months, totaling $2,154 in unpaid tickets.

MTA Police have deployed more officers onto LIRR trains that frequently have fare disputes while instituting a policy last year of having police automatically remove any passenger who refuses to pay a fare. Under the previous system, cops could make the call to let a passenger complete their trip.

MTA officials have said the stepped-up police enforcement efforts have already made a difference.

Summonses for fare evasion on the LIRR more than doubled from 2022 to 2023, when more than 700 summonses were issued, Donovan said. In the first three months of this year, police issued another 550 summonses for fare evasion, up more than 400% from the same period in 2022.

MTA Police also arrested more than 200 people for fare evasion last year, and another 100 in the first quarter of this year, Donovan said.

Newsday reported Monday that the crime rate in 2023 reached its highest point in at least 18 years, including an increase in assaults. Of the 45 assaults last year, 19 were against MTA employees, which officials said have been more actively pursuing fare evasion.",https://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/unpaid-lirr-enforcement-pukco3gw
"MTA, NYPD crackdown on bus fare evaders throughout city, violations led to summonses",2024-08-29 17:00:45.688000+00:00,"NEW YORK (1010 WINS) – A handful of fare evaders were removed from the crosstown M96 bus during a 45-minute sweep by the MTA and NYPD at the East 97th Street and Fifth Avenue bus stop in Manhattan on Thursday.

One rider, Patrina, said she approved of the crackdown, noting that fare evasion is a common issue. “Every day you’re on the bus, you see this happening,” she told 1010 WINS.

Some fare evaders were issued summonses on the spot.

Another rider, Angelina, said, “It’s about time. I mean, every day, every day, every day, I see it here. I see it on the train. I see it at 42nd Street every single day. You’re supposed to pay your fare. Why shouldn’t you?”

New York City Transit President Demetrius Crichlow spoke to the press following the crackdown and stated that similar enforcement efforts are happening across the city. “This is just a small sample of what is going on throughout the entire network of buses,” he said.

Thursday's sweep also included bus routes at Grand Concourse and Fordham Road in the Bronx.

A recent MTA report shows 48% of city bus riders don’t pay the fare. That amounts to nearly 1 million riders skimping on bus fares daily as the MTA faces a projected $900 million combined deficit in 2027 and 2028.

The number of fare-beaters is also more than double what it was in 2018, when 18% of bus riders skipped the fare, according to MTA data.

MTA bus drivers can no longer open back doors due to fare evasion,2022-05-08 00:00:00,"The MTA is ordering its bus drivers not to automatically open their vehicles’ rear and center doors for customers — to try to thwart free-loading scofflaws, The Post has learned.

“Effective immediately, to deter fare evasion,” agency drivers cannot “use the rear door toggle switch to open the rear/center automatically, unless it is necessary due to an emergency situation,” says a May 6 memo sent to all MTA bus operators.

The new directive will ideally force potential fare beaters to enter through the front doors of the bus — and be confronted by the driver if they don’t pay.

It also means bus riders will have to manually activate the rear and center doors themselves if they want to exit through them.

The back and center doors on the MTA’s express “Select Bus Service” routes will continue to open automatically at all stops, the memo said.

“The policy is intended to continue to offer customers easy exits while deterring fare evasion by reducing the time that rear doors are open while no one is exiting on local bus routes,” MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan said in a statement to The Post.

Donovan added that bus drivers can still use an “override switch” to open the back door if the “tape sensor” that operates it is not working.

MTA CEO Janno Lieber last month pledged to tackle soaring subway crime partly by setting up a review panel to figure out how to curb fare evasion, which has jumped on both buses and subways during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nearly 30 percent of city bus riders aren’t paying their way, according to the MTA’s latest fare-evasion survey — up from just over 20 percent at the end of 2019.

But J.P. Patafio, vice president for Transport Workers Local 100’s Brooklyn bus division, called the memo “silly” because drivers rarely open bus back doors themselves, anyway.

He said he hoped the implication would not be that bus operators should haggle for fares, which has led to driver assaults in the past.

“If somebody is coming through the back door, it’s usually because there’s a lot of people getting off the bus,” he said. “The bus driver’s job is already very difficult, and we already know that enforcing fares leads to assault and fights on the bus.”

The MTA’s new directive defies its long-term goal of implementing all-door entry and fare collection on all its buses. OMNY tap-and-go card-payment readers have been installed on all buses but are currently only turned on for Select Bus routes.

Lieber last month told reporters it was too soon to turn on the rear-door OMNY readers because the vast majority of bus riders still pay with MetroCards or cash.

“I think we only have somewhere between 10 and 15 percent OMNY penetration on the buses,” he said. “It wouldn’t really be fair to try to manage rear-door bus boarding and limit it to OMNY customers.”",https://nypost.com/2022/05/08/mta-bus-drivers-can-no-longer-open-back-doors-due-to-fare-evasion/
"MTA Opens Gates in OMNY Snafu, Chilling Riders In Wake of Cops Shooting Alleged ‘Farebeater’",2024-09-18 00:00:00,"Don't shoot — the OMNY isn't working!

MTA workers propped open a gate at the Bedford-Nostrand G station on Wednesday morning after the OMNY system failed at that location, horrifying some riders who were reminded that cops shot four people days earlier while chasing down a man ... who allegedly walked through an open gate at another Brooklyn station.

With the OMNY, credit card and phone readers down, and the gate propped open, the only option for riders was to buy a MetroCard (and pay the $1 new card fee) or enter through the open gate and risk being identified as a fare beater.

That risk can now be seen as life-threatening, after the city’s war against fare evaders turned violent on Sunday: Two NYPD officers shot 37-year-old Derrell Mickles after police said he didn’t pay the fare at the Sutter Avenue L station, and allegedly came at police with a knife. Two bystanders and one cop were caught in the crossfire; one victim had bullet shrapnel removed from his head and is in critical condition.

“It’s interesting that we’re in a time where ... if they don’t have money to pay the fare, you could be collateral damage in some cop’s need to prove a point to enforce a police state in this city,” said Joan Summers, a Philadelphian who was at the Bedford-Nostrand station on Wednesday.

“People need to pay their fare share,” added Jeremy, a Bedford-Stuyesant resident. “But getting shot? No, that’s way more aggressive than it needs to be for a fare evader.”

On Tuesday night, protesters gathered in Brownsville to oppose the crackdown, leading to 18 arrests. Another demonstration is set for tonight at Union Square, as anger lingers, though the problems at Bedford-Nostrand were eventually fixed.

But for hours, OMNY readers at the turnstiles displayed yellow “MetroCard Only” notices at both the Bedford Avenue and Nostrand Avenue entrances.

At the Bedford entrance, riders streamed into the station towards the end of the morning rush with many looking perplexed as they put away their phones and credit cards after they failed to tap into the system.

Some people dug MetroCards out of their wallets to swipe into the station, but not everyone has them on hand in the age of OMNY.

“I always use my phone [to tap in], so I don’t know what people do that don’t have a smartphone,” said Jeremy. “It kind of surprises me that people still use MetroCard.”

“I don’t have a MetroCard because we have OMNY now,” added Summers. “Why would I have a MetroCard?”

Ximena, a subway rider who lives in the neighborhood, usually taps in with OMNY at this station because the MetroCard machine rarely accepts cash. This time, the MetroCard machine was up and running, allowing her to load $30 onto a new card — which triggers a $1 fee. Meanwhile, the adjacent OMNY machine flashed an “out of order” message — the one time when the OMNY machine's failure was not an inconvenience.

they’re shooting people for not paying the mta fare and yet i just got to a station where all of the omny tap to pay were down and you could only pay using a metrocard (which nyers have been discouraged from using for the last several years so many people do not have them) — mel 🥀 (@themelsig) September 18, 2024

On the Nostrand side of the station, the MetroCard machine — next to another defunct OMNY machine — was not accepting bills.

“I’m disappointed,” said one commuter, who declined to give her name, after she used her credit card to add funds to a MetroCard.

While there is a gate agent booth at that end of the station, the MTA staffer disappeared a few minutes after Streetsblog arrived at the scene. The gate at this side wasn’t propped open by a rope and cone, but riders held the door for each other to make the train.

“The MetroCard machine is always messed up,” a commuter named King told Streetsblog as he exited the station. “I had a situation like that two nights ago in Harlem. I was coming down to the train. It wouldn’t take my card, the card reader was messed up. The train’s about to come now. I’m gonna do what I need to do now.”

Riders in Bed-Stuy aren’t the only ones who have had problems with OMNY lately. Students who live more than half a mile from their school are being left out of the free student OMNY program. Earlier this summer, numerous commuters reported that OMNY was preventing them from tapping into the system, and batch charging credit cards after a bungled software update.

Fare evasion cops are out of hand! They're targeting students, even elementary & middle school kids who haven't received their new OMNY cards b/c the @MTA botched the rollout.

The MTA has increasingly been pulling out the stops to curtail fare evasion on transit, which it says cost the system $644 million in 2022. The agency has deployed private security guards across the system to help stop would-be fare-beaters, with The City reporting that the agency has budgeted for more than $35 million to expand the program. At the same time, the MTA is exploring the possibility of employing a “behaviorist” to stop fare evasion through Jedi mind tricks.

Fare evasion is most common on MTA buses, where poor service and slow speeds are leaving riders stranded in the hot sun. The agency has started cracking down on bus-specific fare evasion and ended a free route program as commuters wonder what they’re even paying for.

The MTA is investigating Wednesday's OMNY snafu, a rep for the agency said.

Hack defeats MTA’s $700K subway gates to keep out fare-beaters,2024-01-10 00:00:00,"Forget swiping — or jumping.

Waving one’s hand over an ill-placed sensor is all that’s needed to get past a new set of $700,000 subway gates the MTA is testing to crack down on fare-beating.

The simple hack, first exposed in a TikTok video, was replicated by The Post this week — proving how embarrassingly easy it is to defeat the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s shiny new line of defense against turnstile jumpers.

In the video, posted by a user named kiingspiidertv, a man walks up to the gates at the Sutphin Boulevard-Archer Avenue station in Queens, then leans over the paddles of a neighboring gate and waves his hand over the exit sensor.

The doors fling open, letting him saunter through as if that’s how it was supposed to work.

“How To Avoid Getting A Ticket✅ “NEW NYC TURNSTILE HACK,” the clip is captioned.

But there was another flaw, as Post reporters discovered, namely that the doors stay open for about five seconds — giving fare-beaters plenty of time to scurry through on the heels of paying customers.

This happened several times at the Queens station — as people went through in pairs with only a single ticket swipe.

“One person will pay and three will go through,” an MTA employee at the station told The Post. “Or someone goes through with a stroller and the others just walk through. When I see them, I say, ‘No, you gotta pay.’ I don’t let them through.”

It’s not quite the rollout the agency wanted for the new design, installed late last year as part of a test of potential remedies to the fare-beating plague that robbed $690 million from the city’s coffers in 2022.

6 The gates cost about $700,000 to install. J. Messerschmidt for NY Post

The array replaced the decades-old turnstiles with tall metal paddles that were ostensibly tougher to jump over or crawl under.

They also make it easier for subway riders with bags or luggage to get through — a definite plus at a station that connects to the JFK AirTrain via the larger Jamaica Station complex.

The 8th Avenue-Penn Station A/C/E was slated to be the second station to get the new setup, which cost about $700,000 to install.

6 The flaw was first exposed on TikTok by a user named kiingspiidertv. TikTok/kiingspiiderTV

“I don’t think I’ve seen technology that’s perfect in any city, frankly,” Rich Davey, the MTA’s top executive for the city subway and bus systems, said at the system’s Dec. 4 unveiling. “But this is obviously going a long way to improving our current turnstile system.”

At the Sutphin-Archer station this week, several cops watched the gates, occasionally stopping brazen law-breakers and even writing one man a $100 ticket.

But the MTA is still looking for other solutions, and recently issued a solicitation for a new gate-fare system that specifies “doors and panels must be designed to minimize opportunities to evade fare payment by reaching under, over, or in any way around while in the closed position.”

6 And it worked like magic, with the paddles flying open after a quick wave of the hand. TikTok/kiingspiiderTV

Similar models in Europe employ higher paddles and slightly different dimensions, so changes could be made to the New York models to make them tougher to beat.

In a statement Wednesday, MTA communications director Tim Minton said the agency has a “multi-layered approach to deterring fare evasion driven by a blue-ribbon panel’s report, that includes a search for new fare gate technology, police officers, private guards, transit enforcement teams, discount fare programs and soon, a customer-messaging campaign.”

“In addition, MTAPD officers were assigned to encourage payment compliance through wide gates being piloted at Sutphin-Archer station shortly after they were installed there,” Minton said.

New York’s Finest had their own doubts about the gates’ efficacy.

“I don’t think they are effective,” one officer at the Sutphin-Archer station said. “The gates stay open too long. People can just push through, and they do. You can’t catch everyone.”

The cop also said the gates are open for too long — instead, the MTA should have created special areas with slower gates for people with luggage, strollers or wheelchairs.

When asked if fare evasion is worth a $100 ticket, the officer said it must be, since people are still doing it.

6 The TikTok page showed how easy the hack is — and riders have already figured out the gates stay open longer than they should, making it easy to scurry behind paying customers. tiktok.com/@kiingspiiderllc/

“In rush hour, when you have so many more people going through, even more people are going to slip by,” the cop said.

The MTA employee was more optimistic.

“You are going to pay a $100 fine for a $2.90 ticket?” she asked. “It’s not worth it.”",https://nypost.com/2024/01/10/metro/hack-defeats-mtas-700k-subway-gates-to-keep-out-fare-beaters/

NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- The MTA unveiled the most recent improvement to the transit system and it's one they hope will save them some money.

Top officials at the MTA demonstrated high-tech subway turnstiles that are more difficult to evade at Grand Central Terminal.

The redesigned turnstiles, which are glass gates, would replace the existing token-era entranceways, are more modern, and would increase accessibility.

Fare evasion cost the MTA $690 million in 2022, according to the transit authority.

To stop the bleeding, a blue-ribbon panel of 16 New Yorkers was assembled to recommend improvements to enforcement, fare subsidies and replacing existing subway turnstiles with more modern fare control devices.

The MTA is on track to lose $1 billion this year due to fare evasion, which makes new technology an urgent issue for officials.

While new turnstiles will solve some of the problems, officials said fare evasion and what to do about it is complicated.

""It raises questions about enforcement, but also equality and affordability, the things that the MTA is intensely focused on making better in New York,"" MTA CEO Janno Lieber said.

Additionally, the emergency exit gates may soon have a delay because that's how most fare evaders get through.

Gate guards are already being deployed at 30 stations with the highest incidence of fare evasion.

These new turnstiles come amid a heated debate on congestion pricing, which could help fund needed improvements in the public transit system.

RELATED | MTA reveals new details about nation's 1st congestion pricing plan in New York City

The MTA unveiled the details of NYC's congestion pricing plan and say it will mean less traffic, safer streets, cleaner air and better transit.

The plan aims to reduce traffic in the busiest parts of Manhattan while at the same time providing needed funding for mass transit, but it remains unpopular.

Under congestion pricing, in one scenario, driving into the city could cost $90 per day.The Port Authority toll is $17, congestion pricing south of 60th Street would run $23, and parking would cost $50.

The Federal Highway Administration greenlight the plan after reviewing its environmental and legal impact.

If the plan receives the final stamp of approval then implementation will be in the hands of New York City, New York State and the Traffic Mobility Review Board, the six-member body that will hold public hearings to determine things like toll prices and exemptions.

Based on the current timetable, congestion pricing could be implemented as early as April 2024.

Fare Evasion Spikes on NYC's Transit System,2024-08-26 00:00:00,"Approximately one in two bus passengers failed to pay the fare when boarding a bus in New York City in the first three months of 2024, according to the latest stats from the Metropolitan Transit Authority.

That's nearly half of all bus riders. On the subways, some 14% of riders skipped paying. The rampant fare evasion has prompted the MTA to deploy a crew of ""fare inspectors"" on buses and at bus stops in a bid to stem the problem.

Fare evasion has spiked since the COVID-19 pandemic, when, in 2020, 21% of bus riders skipped paying. Now, it's more than double that.

The standard fare for subway riders and most bus passengers is $2.90 per trip.

Bus fare evasion cost the MTA some $312 million in revenue in 2022 alone, according to a 2023 report commissioned by the MTA.

Although much worse now, the MTA says bus fare evasion has been a serious problem for years. In 2018 some 18% of bus riders failed to pay the fare, compared to other major cities, like Paris, where 11% of riders failed to pay, or Toronto where the rate was 5%.

Transit union leaders discourage drivers from confronting fare evaders over fears they will be assaulted. One bus driver told the New York Post, ""Out of a busload of people — let's say 10 people got on, maybe two paid."" He added, ""I just look the other way — we're taught not to fight the fare. We've got people that have gotten assaulted and stabbed because of them fighting the fare.""",https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/nyc-mta-subway/2024/08/26/id/1177987/
Lieber says current subway turnstiles ‘too porous’ as MTA seeks redesign to combat fare evasion,2022-12-06 14:05:47-05:00,"The MTA is looking at redesigning the subway turnstile to make fare evasion more difficult.

Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

The MTA is contemplating a redesign of the subway turnstile to deter what it calls rampant fare evasion costing the cash-strapped agency hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

In a Tuesday radio interview, Lieber said that the subway fare gate is “too porous” and makes it easy for anyone to board a train without paying.

“The turnstiles, frankly, it seems like we’re trying to cultivate a generation of world-class gymnasts,” Lieber told Brigitte Quinn of 1010 WINS. “Because you can just put your hands on the side and vault over them. We’ve gotta deal with that, whether it’s raising the height or changing the design so it’s not so easy for people to vault.”

Metro systems in other cities like San Francisco, Washington DC, and London have adopted automated fare gates that open from the center out, and only if a fare is paid. The gates are significantly harder to hop than the low, spinning turnstile used in New York.

The emergency exit gate, meanwhile, has become a “superhighway for fare evasion,” with one ne’er-do-well who opens the gate enabling scores of straphangers to waltz onto the subway platform without shelling out the requisite $2.75.

“One person goes in, sometimes they jump the turnstile, and they pop the gate open for 5, 10, 15 people. We’ve all seen it,” Lieber said. “And it is demoralizing, it is destructive to the sense of fairness and fair play that animates New York … and it’s also contributing to the sense of disorder in the system.”

Earlier this year, the MTA formed a “blue ribbon” panel tasked with devising a plan for the agency to combat fare evasion, which Lieber says costs the agency an estimated $500 million annually. The panel is expected to release its findings by the end of this year.

That $500 million is not chump change, especially given the authority’s grim fiscal outlook. The agency’s preliminary 2023 financial plan, released last month, calls for an 11% increase in transit fares over the next three years, potentially raising the price of a subway or bus ride to $3.05 by 2025. The agency is also engaged in a major cost-cutting effort to bring down its operating expenditures as ridership stagnates at about 60% of pre-pandemic levels, and billions of dollars in federal aid runs dry.

Even with that in mind, the MTA still needs another $600 million in new revenue to materialize by next year to plug its budget deficit, and new cash sources going forward as projected ridership remains below 2019 benchmarks.

Fare evasion arrests soar

Police presence has surged underground since a particularly gruesome month of October in the subway system. The surge in cops, frequently announced over the intercom to straphangers by train crews, has been accompanied by the deployment of unarmed guards at fare arrays intended to deter would-be turnstile jumpers.

Arrests and summonses for fare evasion have skyrocketed since the October surge; Lieber told 1010 WINS arrests are up by 100% and summonses up 60% over last year.

But advocates have long decried fare evasion enforcement as racially targeted and irrelevant to public safety. While Lieber excoriated well-to-do fare evaders in “business suits” or carrying lattes on the radio, the NYPD’s most recent fare evasion data, from the third quarter of 2022, shows 94% of fare evasion arrests were against Black and Latino riders.

The gate guard pilot at certain stations has suggested the security expenditures could pay for themselves, the chair said, with the savings from having fewer turnstile jumpers.

But at the end of the day, he says it’s not even about the money, but the principle.

“It’s not just that it’s costing the MTA money,” Lieber said. “When a hard-working person swipes their MetroCard or taps their OMNY, and they see 10 people go by them through the gate, it makes you feel like a sucker. And I don’t want that to be the vibe of the subway system.”",https://www.amny.com/transit/mta-lieber-subway-turnstiles-redesign-fare-evasion/

EAST NEW YORK, Brooklyn (WABC) -- An irate passenger opened fire at an MTA bus stop in Brooklyn after allegedly refusing to pay the fare Tuesday morning.

The man was ejected off an SBS B82 bus for allegedly refusing to pay the fare near the intersection of Flatlands and Louisiana Avenues in East New York.

Members of the MTA's Eagle Team were walking the rider to a fare machine at the bus stop when he allegedly became enraged, turned, and opened fire at the MTA workers.

One of the MTA employees was grazed in the leg, according to officials.

""There is somebody who had a MetroCard on him, who for some reason didn't want to pay the fare, they did their job, they asked him to get off the bus, and lo and behold, he produced a .45 and took shots at our employees,"" said Janno Lieber, MTA chairman, and CEO. ""I can't put up with that. The MTA won't put up with that and we are working closely with the NYPD.""

The gunman described only as a man with a backpack, fled north on Louisiana Avenue.

""We have camera footage that is helping the NYPD identify this suspect, not just from the bus that the guy had just been ejected from, but from another bus that was coming by,"" Lieber said. ""The cameras are working, the NYPD is going to get the guy.""

Resident Maurice Foster said he sympathizes with those struggling, but that it's unfair when he pays and sees countless others refuse.

""Lately it's been kinda crazy with the buses and the bus fares and a lot of people riding the buses for free,"" Foster said. ""And I guess ever since the pandemic people were getting on the bus and not paying.""

MTA statistics meanwhile show overall bus fare evasion has been on the rise with almost 40% of riders not paying.

Lieber said fare evasion crackdowns have helped get guns off the system.

""In the last week or two, there have been like three to five separate incidents where fare evasion enforcement by the NYPD has led to collars for carrying a loaded gun,"" Lieber said. ""This is an important function. I'm proud of the fact that we are trying to do it in the non-armed fare enforcement agent approach, which is one that some people have advocated. It's certainly a new way to do fare evasion but if people are going to take shots at our employees, we are just not going to put up with it.""

But riders still worry if it's enough to keep things from escalating out of control.

""I mean what's gonna happen when the fares go even higher,"" one rider asked.

Police are continuing to search for the gunman.

Nearly one-third of NYC bus riders aren’t paying the fare,2022-02-21 00:00:00,"Nearly 30 percent of NYC bus riders aren’t paying their fare — costing the transit authority $56 million in the last three months of 2021 alone, according to the MTA’s latest fare evasion survey.

Transit number-crunchers estimated some 29.3 percent of riders on local bus routes did not pay the fare in the final three months of 2021 — up from 25.2 percent in the three months before that, the report showed.

The troubling spike brings the reported local bus fare evasion to the highest it’s been in at least a decade, according to a source familiar with the agency’s survey methodology.

“The high rate is mostly being driven by [an approximately] 50 percent non-payment rate in the Bronx, and a jump in non-payment on Staten Island,” the source said.

Transit coffers lost more funding to bus fare evasion in the final quarter of 2021 than from subway fare beaters. Even though there are nearly three times as many subway riders as bus riders, the evasion rate underground was below 8 percent over the same period, costing the authority $41 million.

“If you can get away with not paying your fare on the bus, chances are you’ll also try it on subways,” warned MTA board member Andrew Albert. “We’re talking about massive fare loss on buses, which hurts the people who need it the most — the poor and those who cannot afford massive fare increases.”

MTA leaders have been sounding the alarm about fare evasion since 2017, but with little success. An audit last year by state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli noted that farebeating had actually increased since the $24 million-per-year enforcement effort began.

Two of the city’s five district attorneys, in Manhattan and Brooklyn, stopped prosecuting transit “theft of services” in 2018.

The NYPD, however, still gives tickets for the violation on subways — some 14,573 in the fourth quarter of 2021 — and occasionally makes arrests. Bus enforcement, however, is non-existent: The Transit Bureau did not issue a single bus fare evasion summons in all of 2021, according to publicly available stats.

An MTA rep said enforcement teams are deployed to local buses each day. Transit inspectors issued 39,055 summonses to bus fare beaters in 2021, of which “a vast majority” carried $100 fines, the MTA said.

“By starving the public transportation system of funds, fare evasion is a crime against ordinary New Yorkers who pay their fare,” spokesman Aaron Donovan said in a statement. “That’s why NYC Transit deploys enforcement teams to combat bus fare evasion on a daily basis. It’s easier to pay a $2.75 fare than a $100 fine.”

MTA Chair Janno Lieber acknowledged the persistence of bus fare evasion during testimony before the state Legislature last Tuesday.

Lieber attributed the increased noncompliance in part to the five-month period in 2020 when buses went fare-free to limit interactions between drivers and riders amid the ongoing spread of COVID-19.

“There’s no question that we had a very confusing fare payment period with the bus system in particular, where we closed down the front door to protect the drivers, and then everybody got on the back, they didn’t pay for a while,” he said. “The whole fare payment system has slightly broken down on buses, in my view.”

TWU Local 100 vice president JP Patafio, who represents Brooklyn bus drivers, said the problem has gotten so out of hand that he is skeptical that enforcement would help.

“I don’t know that there’s a police solution to 29 percent fare evasion,” Patafio said. “They should look at making local bus service free. As we saw during the pandemic, it’s an essential public service — like, the most essential of the essential.”",https://nypost.com/2022/02/21/nearly-one-third-of-nyc-bus-riders-arent-paying-the-fare/
"LIRR's top fare evaders owe thousands, skip on paying for 100-plus rides — in just 6 months",2024-04-22 09:00:00+00:00,"Some Long Island Rail Road riders have been issued IOU invoices for unpaid train tickets more than 100 times within just six months and owe thousands of dollars for those trips, according to the MTA's list of fare beaters obtained by Newsday. As the LIRR's list of “repeat offenders” grows, so too has the number of invoices issued to passengers who say they can't pay for their rides — up 60% last year, from about 100,000 in 2022 to nearly 160,000 in 2023, according to MTA figures. The LIRR’s most persistent evader, according to the data, received 155 invoices as of September, totaling $2,154 in unpaid tickets — the most owed by any person on the list. MTA officials said the list reflects six months of data, which means the individual skipped out on 155 fares in about 180 days. Even though Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials have acknowledged that sending scofflaws home with bills that most never pay doesn’t work, the system remains in place — recently augmented with increased police enforcement. A package of new laws just passed by the State Legislature will also help address fare evasion on the LIRR, officials said, including by increasing penalties for repeat offenders and directing revenue from fines back to the railroad. The 10 passengers who have skipped out on the most fares received 1,119 separate bills, totaling $17,108, according to MTA data. The top 10 fare beaters each have been issued between 87 and 155 invoices, and owe between $1,277 and $2,154. Gerard Bringmann, chairman of the LIRR Commuter Council, an advocacy group, said he long had known about the list, which the railroad began compiling in 2014, but called it “shocking” that some riders had “actually cracked 100"" unpaid invoices. “It’s not fare evasion. … That’s transit shoplifting,” said Bringmann, who also sits on the MTA Board as a nonvoting rider representative. “I would love, personally, to see some of these people get arrested.” The list of the LIRR’s most frequent fare evaders reveals the ineffectiveness of the railroad’s system of dealing with a rider who can’t, or refuses, to buy a ticket. Under MTA policy, such a passenger is issued an “invoice for fare not paid,” also known as an “ADL 6009"" form, and directed to mail payment to the railroad. In November, Newsday reported the LIRR in 2022 had written more than 100,000 invoices worth nearly $1.4 million to passengers who said they could not pay for their tickets. That climbed to 159,691 invoices in 2023, worth $2,137,877. The LIRR has said it only recovers around 5% of the unpaid fares owed. Passengers with multiple outstanding invoices are placed on an “ineligible list” maintained by the MTA. LIRR conductors, who keep the lists with them on digital devices, are instructed to notify MTA Police if they encounter a passenger who doesn’t pay a fare and is on the list. As of September, the “ADL 6009 — Ineligible List,” obtained by Newsday through a public records request, was 105 pages. Although it contained more than 6,300 names of “repeat offenders,” many appear to be duplicates, with variations in spellings. Passengers are not required to provide ID when they are issued the invoices, and sometimes give conductors different names when issued multiple invoices, MTA and union officials have said. Because of that uncertainty, Newsday is not publishing the names on the list. MTA spokesperson David Steckel said, despite receiving inconsistent information, transit officials make an effort to match unpaid-for trips to individual riders, including by trying to verify names and addresses, and observing travel patterns. Even accounting for apparent duplicates, at least 33 individuals have accrued 50 or more unpaid invoices, totaling $36,878, according to a Newsday analysis of the data. Baldwin commuter Denzel Francis said he understands that “sometimes, people left their wallet” and legitimately can’t pay for their LIRR ride. But, Francis said, watching fellow passengers repeatedly game the system makes paying riders “furious.” “If I’m paying, why do they not have to pay?” Francis, 32, asked while waiting for his train at Penn Station. According to a 2019 audit from State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, “the LIRR uses its invoice database to compile a list of the top 800 individuals who have requested seven or more invoices with a total value of over $100.” However, the list provided to Newsday included riders with as few as five invoices, and total values as small as $21. Amid intensifying scrutiny of its finances, the MTA has ramped up its efforts to address fare and toll evasion, which it says costs the transit agency about $700 million a year, including subway turnstile jumping and faked and obscured license plates. Since late last year, LIRR conductors at Penn Station have been checking tickets on some trains before passengers board. The pilot program initially targeted only trains after Madison Square Garden events, but has been extended to trains at other times too. MTA Police has deployed more officers onto LIRR trains that frequently have fare disputes while instituting a policy of having police resolve fare disputes at a station platform. Under the previous system, cops intervening in a fare dispute could make the call to let a passenger complete their trip, MTA Police Chief John Mueller told the MTA Board in February. But they learned from conductors that system “didn't really work well.” “Now you have a person who they tried to get a fare from, they didn't pay the fare, and we allowed them to remain there. It's not a safe situation,” Mueller said when talking about the new fare dispute procedures. “We can still exercise discretion on the platform. It doesn't mean that somebody is definitely going to see enforcement of a summons or an arrest. But it is no longer on the train.” Asked about how the new policing strategy has impacted fare-beating recidivism on the LIRR, MTA chairman and CEO Janno Lieber told Newsday that it has “not remedied” the problem, but is acting as a deterrent. “When a conductor comes across a fare evader, they can have a cop intervene, because there's a cop on the train,” Lieber said following the February meeting. “What they're doing, for the first time, I think, in a long time, is they're taking them off the train. So that is probably a significant discouragement for people, irrespective of what process follows.” Anthony Simon, who heads the union representing LIRR conductors, said that while the steps taken have been an improvement, there remain holes for opportunistic fare beaters to exploit. Because much of the fare beating takes place between New York City stations — and cops can't ride every train — offenders often can complete their trip before a cop boards a train to intervene. “Our organization has conveyed to the LIRR for the past several years that the current policy of billing riders is just enabling bad behavior,” said Simon, adding that his union’s top priority is protecting train crews from continued harassment and assaults. In March of last year, a rider who refused to pay his fare assaulted two conductors with a ticket-issuing machine he swiped from one of them, according to police. In December, a conductor was pepper-sprayed on a Queens station platform by a passenger following a fare dispute, police said. “We need a way to protect our train crews from the continued harassment and assaults they have been enduring,” said Simon, who noted that, while many passengers look to conductors to address fare evasion, LIRR employees “are not cops.” MTA officials said the stepped-up police enforcement efforts have already made a big difference. The number of summonses issued for fare nonpayment on the LIRR more than doubled from 321 in 2022 to 698 last year. In the first quarter of 2024, MTA Police have already issued 513 summonses to LIRR riders, according to MTA figures. Fare beating arrests on the LIRR are also up substantially, from 55 in 2022 to 194 in 2023, with 101 more through March of this year. However, fines collected go to the local jurisdictions that adjudicate the summonses, and not to the railroads. Lisa Daglian, executive director of the MTA's Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, who was part of a panel of experts who made recommendations to the MTA on how to address fare evasion, said a package of law amendments just adopted by lawmakers as part of the state budget process will help address repeat fare beaters. Among them: a measure that would move railroad fare evasion summonses from local courts to an “adjudication bureau” at the MTA that would better track repeat offenders, and allow the LIRR to keep the revenue collected from fines. Other new measures would increase the top fine for repeat fare evasion offenses from $100 to $150. New provisions would also forgive fines for some low-income riders eligible for discounted fare programs, and for offenders who “satisfactorily perform unpaid services” on the LIRR, including cleaning trains. Those and other measures would allow the MTA to improve fare collection without abruptly pulling the plug on the IOU system, and potentially escalating already-volatile fare disputes, she said. “It didn't happen overnight that it evolved into this bad system. So it's not going to happen overnight that it evolves into a good system,” Daglian said. “But there are steps that can be taken.” Seaford commuter William DeVito said that while he believes fare beating remains a major problem in the New York City subway system, he doesn't see it often while commuting and from work on the LIRR. If the LIRR wants to address the problem of lost fare revenue, DeVito said it should do a better job of collecting fares from ticket-holding passengers. A report on fare evasion published by the MTA last May estimated that a third of all LIRR fares are either uncollected or collected incorrectly, costing the railroad about $24 million annually. “The biggest problem with the railroad losing money is when a conductor doesn't take tickets,” said DeVito, 27, who routinely observes a conductor not collecting fares because a train is too crowded to walk through. “So, it's not his fault. But it happens all the time.”

Some Long Island Rail Road riders have been issued IOU invoices for unpaid train tickets more than 100 times within just six months and owe thousands of dollars for those trips, according to the MTA's list of fare beaters obtained by Newsday.

As the LIRR's list of “repeat offenders” grows, so too has the number of invoices issued to passengers who say they can't pay for their rides — up 60% last year, from about 100,000 in 2022 to nearly 160,000 in 2023, according to MTA figures.

The LIRR’s most persistent evader, according to the data, received 155 invoices as of September, totaling $2,154 in unpaid tickets — the most owed by any person on the list. MTA officials said the list reflects six months of data, which means the individual skipped out on 155 fares in about 180 days.

Even though Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials have acknowledged that sending scofflaws home with bills that most never pay doesn’t work, the system remains in place — recently augmented with increased police enforcement.

MTA changing emergency exits to squash subway fare evasion,2024-01-31 00:00:00,"The MTA’s faregate experiment at the Sutphin Blvd.-Archer Ave.-JFK subway station is showing results — a 20% reduction in fare evasion, say MTA officials, who attribute the improvement mainly to the removal of an emergency gate through which fare evaders often entered the Queens train stop.

The new gates, installed in December, replaced one bank of turnstiles at the station with motorized, plexiglass gates that move out of the way after a fare is paid.

The system, manufactured by MetroCard contractor Cubic, cost the MTA $700,000.

“Those particular models have come in for some criticism, not unjustifiably,” MTA Chairman Janno Lieber said Wednesday.

Lieber was referring to videos circulating on social media showing some straphangers reaching around the new faregate at the downtown Jamaica station to trip an exit sensor, which opens the gates and lets them enter for free.

“Changes are being made,” Lieber said.

But the MTA boss said even with that free-ride flaw, fare evasion at the station went down — because the new system allowed the agency to remove one of the station’s emergency gates.

“Revenue is up 20% just from not having the gate open as frequently,” he said.

The agency is taking the stat as proof that securing the gates — which Lieber has taken to calling “superhighways” of fare evasion — will begin to stanch the MTA’s $700 million-a-year nonpayment problem.

To that end, the agency plans on placing 15-second delays on the emergency exits at three subway stations in the coming weeks.

The time-delay gates will be installed at Bushwick’s Flushing Ave. station on the J and M lines, Mott Haven’s Third Ave.-138th St. station on the No. 6 train, and the E. 59th St. station serving the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 trains on the Upper East Side.

The time-delay system would keep the gate from unlocking for 15 seconds after a passenger pushed the exit bar, in an effort to discourage the gate’s use as an ordinary, nonemergency exit.

Lieber balked at suggestions Wednesday that the 15-second delay could cause safety issues.

“We’ve gotten approval from the code authorities [and] the fire experts on how to do that, and we’re going to do it,” he said.

“We’re not letting New Yorkers walk up to the turnstile and pay their fare, and look over at somebody who has their MetroCard in their hand or OMNY open on their phone [instead] go for the gate because it’s open,” Lieber added.

An MTA spokesman said that the delayed gates would have signs identifying them as such, and added there are currently no plans to bring the delay to any of the subway system’s 150 wheelchair-accessible stations.

Meanwhile, the agency continues to weigh its options for a wholesale replacement of the turnstile system.

Eight months after holding a showcase of modern faregates at Grand Central Terminal last spring, the agency has finally begun vetting companies as potential vendors to deliver such a system to New York.

Officials said they hope to have that list finalized in a few weeks before starting to solicit formal proposals.

But a farewell to the turnstile — and with it, officials hope, a significant chunk of the fare evasion problem — is likely a long way off.

“We’re going to keep experimenting with new types of fare gates, in part so that we are smarter as we select and design something for the MTA system in a bigger way,” Lieber said Wednesday.

The total amount of money lost to fare evasion in 2023 is not yet available, an MTA spokesman told the Daily News.

In 2022, the MTA lost $690 million lost across the transit system to nonpayment. Of that, $285 million was lost to fare-beating on the subway.

Fare evasion is an even bigger problem on MTA buses, where the agency lost $315 million in 2022.

Officials said Wednesday that buses continue to lead subways in both the percentage of riders who don’t pay and the total dollar amount lost, despite a recent enforcement push on local bus routes.

Bus Ridership is Near 2019 Levels (If You Count the People Who Don’t Pay),2023-11-16 00:00:00,"It's Bus Week! Welcome to the latest installment in Streetsblog's annual ""Bus Week,"" where we explore why New York City buses are so horrible and what Mayor Adams is or is not doing. Today, we'll look bus fare evasion. For prior ""Bus Week"" coverage, click here.

Bus riders have come back, but the MTA isn't counting all of them.

The MTA's daily ridership figures show bus ridership has flatlined at about 60 percent of pre-pandemic ridership, about 1.2 million to 1.4 million riders per weekday. But data that the agency publishes in its Board books every month reveals that total bus ridership is surging.

In September, it was closer to 2.3 million people — near the highs in the pre-pandemic halcyon of 2019 — if you include riders who didn't pay:

Figures from the MTA's October's Board book. Chart: MTA

So, no, neither the MTA's blue ribbon panel nor stated commitment to making fare enforcement a part of the agency's core identity has stopped the gratis groundswell. But does it matter? After all, people who don't pay for the bus are people who are just trying to get somewhere, too.

""These are people going to work, they're going out to jobs, to shop or going to a doctor's appointment,"" said Transport Workers Local 100 Vice President JP Patafio. ""They've gotta get where they've gotta get to, and public transportation is generally the best way to do that. And they don't have the fare, they're short two bucks, you're gonna jump on the bus. So I think it just shows the need for a robust transit system.""

The unofficial rebound of bus ridership comes as the MTA works to win back riders to public transit in numbers closer to before the pandemic, and leaders in the city and state debate whether transit will ever make it all the way back (or if ""Friday is dead forever,"" as the saying goes).

With total, albeit not officially recognized, bus ridership back to baseline figures, pro-transit legislators are calling for faster and more reliable bus service.

""We are hitting numbers that we are not recognizing, because our focus has been on fares,"" said Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani (D-Astoria), who spearheaded a push for an MTA rescue package and a free bus pilot this past spring. ""But our focus needs to be on what the intended outcomes are of providing this kind of service.""

The data also creates an awkward financial situation for the MTA, which got a rescue package from Albany this year. Through September, the MTA's expected revenue from bus ridership was $28.2 million short of projections (Bus service in New York City is provided by both New York City Transit and the MTA Bus Company).

And the fare evasion numbers also skew the agency's recovery picture. Subways and commuter rails are routinely breaking 70 percent of pre-pandemic ridership, while official bus ridership is stuck in the high 50/low 60 percent recovery range — in other words, at the low end of the ridership projections McKinsey and Co. did for the agency.

The MTA's Blue Ribbon Panel on fare evasion noted that bus fare-hopping is more common than its cousins at the subway turnstile or at bridge tollbooths. This summer, the agency began deploying its anti-fare evasion EAGLE Teams to local bus hubs as an education and deterrence effort to both remind people to pay the fare to get on the bus, and to tell riders about the half-price Fair Fares program that's funded by the city.

""Counterintuitively, doing less intense anti-fare evasion efforts, while at the same time making paying the fare as easy as humanly possible and expanding the Fair Fares program, all that is going to help,"" said Stephen Maples, who worked on fare evasion analyses at the MTA before leaving the authority in 2022.

The more targeted efforts to encourage fare payment have been a bit hampered. A push to expand the half-fair Fair Fares program from 100 percent of the federal poverty line, which is $14,580 for a single person, to 200 percent of the poverty limit or $29,160, stalled with an agreement to add funding to bring in people making 120 percent of the federal poverty limit, which is $17,496.

And right now, the MTA is hampered in its own efforts to fight fare evasion on local bus routes by the fact that the rollout of the OMNY system has fallen off schedule and is only used by about 30 percent of bus riders.

OMNY is necessary for all-door boarding, itself an advancement in bus operations that's been kiboshed by the MTA because of fare evasion concerns. Widespread adoption of OMNY could also allow local buses to use the European-style proof-of-payment model, which the agency uses on Select Bus Service, thanks to off-board fare payment.

The ridership rebound suggests that the demand for bus service remains as high as ever, which also means that the city and the MTA need to ensure that bus priority projects keep moving forward and that efforts to speed up buses with things like all-door boarding and bus redesigns need to be finished as soon as possible. Good service after all, could not only attract more riders, but could get lapsed fare payees to pay for the bus.

""We should be thinking of this in a way that centers service because if we're focusing on service and making service better, I think over time, people will be more willing and likely to pay the fare. I think a lot of times people feeling the pinch and feeling like the service isn't awesome, so they just say 'Nah.'""

""This is an excellent indicator that people want to use public transit to get where they need to go, and it's a call to our political leadership to figure out a better a better way forward,"" said Maples.

For Mamdani, the fare evasion numbers show a need to keep pushing forward on expanding the free bus pilot that the MTA began in September. One bus route in each borough is currently free to ride, and Astoria lawmaker said that the program is getting good reviews from riders and drivers.

""I'm not naive to the fact that there is an economic necessity, in terms of how the MTA does its budgeting, where fare collection plays a significant role in allowing operations to continue,"" he said. ""However, what we need to do is replace the source of the generation of that revenue from riders to the wealthiest New Yorkers and New York institutions that we have across this state. And what this data shows us is that we are missing the forest for the trees.""

A report earlier this year from the city's Independent Budget Office pegged the cost of fully free local bus system (local, limited and SBS buses) at $652 million per year, though MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber has said he thinks the agency would lose $1 billion per year if the buses across the city were free.

Patafio also praised the free bus pilot and said that the question is not one of how to do better fare enforcement but how to best prioritize what New York State puts its money towards.

""The average bus rider is making $30,000, $35,000. When you think about who's taking the bus, that's the working class. The buses are essential to them, and they don't earn a lot of money. So we've got to figure out, do you want to fund war or stadiums or do you want to fund public service that's essential for New York City?"" he said.

A leader of the MTA's panel on fare evasion said he was confident that the agency was working to institute the ideas the body had recommended to fight fare evasion.

""Improving fare compliance on buses is key to a healthy transit system that all New Yorkers can depend on,"" said Roger Maldonado, the co-chair of the Blue-Ribbon Panel on MTA Fare and Toll Evasion. ""Our report found that buses have become the MTA’s single biggest fare evasion problem – both the highest cash loss and the highest evasion rate – and that’s why we made specific recommendations for reducing bus evasion. We know the MTA team is hard at work on this and we look forward to seeing their progress.",https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/16/bus-ridership-is-near-2019-levels-if-you-count-the-people-who-dont-pay

HUDSON VALLEY, NY — It isn't exactly a common occurrence, but ride a Metro-North train long enough and you will likely see a conductor otherwise engaged with a passenger who has no interest in either presenting or purchasing a ticket. A new, expanded pilot program will see some of these difficult conversations taking place on the platform, rather than occupying the conductor's time and sometimes even delaying departure from the station.

According to MTA Spokesperson Joana Flores, this less familiar method of collecting tickets is known as ""gating,"" and the expansion has its roots in a 2023 blue-ribbon report on MTA fare and toll evasion — though the practice has been used occasionally for decades. Flores said the newest ""gating"" pilot program is intended as much to educate riders about the importance of having tickets purchased and mobile tickets activated prior to boarding as it is to discourage potential scofflaws. Checking tickets and passes before boarding has the added benefit of dissuading passengers from not activating e-tickets once on the train to get a free ride.

During the gating exercises, passengers are expected to have their paper tickets ready, or e-tickets activated, to present to a railroad employee before boarding trains. ""Metro-North Railroad will be gating at one station per month,"" Flores told Patch. ""The focus has been at Grand Central Terminal and Harlem-125 St, as suggested by the blue ribbon report, with intention of expanding to other stations, where feasible.""



The MTA said that while the pilot program will experiment with expanding the use of gating at Metro-North stations, the railroad has a great deal of experience using the ticket collection method. Metro-North Railroad has been gating every home Yankee game since the station’s opening on May 8, 2009, and at Grand Central Terminal for Thanksgiving and New Year's for over 25 years. The LIRR has been gating at Mets-Willets Point and Forest Hills for many events since around 2006 and 2013, respectively. The LIRR has since expanded to also include piloting the gating program at Penn Station and Elmont-UBS Arena, and now routinely gates at Elmont-UBS Arena for certain events.",https://patch.com/new-york/larchmont/metro-north-looks-platform-help-stymie-fare-evaders

NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- The ""chronic problem of fare evasion"" has prompted a new initiative in the MTA, Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber announced Tuesday, starting with empaneling a group to figure out a way to get people to pay their fare.

Lieber, speaking at the Association for a Better New York's Power Breakfast, said that ""surging fare evasion threatens our bottom line and also threatens our social norms,"" as well as feeding the increasing crime, noting that many criminals enter the system by not paying the fare.

New numbers revealed assaults, stabbings, and arrests are all up this year, and even with arrests up 63% this year, it doesn't appear to be slowing the violent crime.

On Monday, a man was killed on a subway platform in Queens during an argument near the turnstiles at the Jamaica Center - Parsons Avenue Station.

The suspect pulled out a gun and fired five shots, killing 24-year-old Marcus Bethea.

7 On Your Side Investigates has more on subway crime trends across New York City.

Lieber said the shooting involved ""two guys who apparently knew each other."" NYPD Chief of Transit Jason Wilcox said at Monday's press briefing that there were no officers present in the ticket booth area of the station when the fight began.

The violence came just hours after the NYPD released data showing felony assaults are up 33% from 2021 and up more than 50% from last month. Stabbings and slashings in transit are up 70% compared to last year.

The MTA will convene a ""Fareness"" panel to take a deep dive into how fare evasion is addressed. On buses, approximately one out of every three riders evades the fare.

""At the current rates, fare-beating is going to cost us over $500 million just this year,"" Lieber said. ""Fare evasion is a problem we're going to have to solve together.""

The panel, which includes Schools Chancellor David Banks and Association for a Better New York's first Chief Executive Officer Melva Miller, will focus on three areas -- education, equity and enforcement -- and look for ""a fresh mix"" of tools to curb fare evasion like ""greater use of civil penalties that aren't administered by the police.""

He noted that parking tickets are written by traffic agents, not police officers.

""I am not interested in sending people to jail, especially young people who make mistakes, or low in come New Yorkers,"" he said. ""Failure to pay $2.75...shouldn't change the trajectory of anybody's life.""

Lieber acknowledged that subway safety is key in the city's return but, it will not be a quick fix.

""Crime in the subway is directly connected to what's going on above ground,"" Lieber said. ""This is not an overnight process.""

""Fareness"" Blue-Ribbon Panelists:

--David Banks, Chancellor, NYC Department of Education

--Matthew Fishbein, Former Executive Assistant District Attorney, Kings County; former partner, Debevoise & Plimpton; former Chief of Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York and former First Assistant U.S. Attorney, Eastern District of New York

MTA deploys armed security guards to avoid fare evasion,2022-11-30 00:00:00,"The MTA said riders skipping fares will cost the agency $500 million this year alone because it happens so often.

“Especially when it’s busy, you’ll see people hop over nonchalantly and skip over. I see it a couple times a day to be honest with you,” said Rachel Mullins, a subway rider.

The agency hired a private security firm to help prevent the loss in revenue.

Meanwhile at 12 other stations, unarmed guards were placed by emergency gates



The pilot program began six months ago and the MTA said preliminary results from placing armed and unarmed guards in stations may claw back tens of thousands of dollars in projected losses, but riders still find loopholes at the emergency gates

The MTA said armed guards were placed at MetroCard machines in two Brooklyn stations, the Halsey Street station and the Myrtle Avenue Wyckoff station, to prevent vandalism.

At 12 other stations, unarmed guards have been placed by emergency gates.

The pilot program began six months ago, and the MTA said preliminary results from placing unarmed guards in stations may claw back tens of thousands of dollars in projected losses, but riders still find loopholes at the emergency gates.

“Once that gate is open, it’s like Black Friday in Macy’s. I’m sorry. Once that gate’s open, the floodgates are open and people come in. So the more we control that gate, the less fare evasion we can have at a station,” said Robert Diehl, the senior vice president of safety and security for the MTA.

On Wednesday afternoon, two unarmed guards at the Myrtle Wyckoff station were standing by the gates. But once they left, riders opened the door for others to avoid the fare.

The extra security didn’t appear popular amongst the New Yorkers NY1 spoke with.

“For fare evasion, I think the armed guards is a bit much, I think it’s a little aggressive, I can see them standing by the turnstiles because that’s where it happen,” said Mullins.

“I feel like it’s not that serious to have all these security guards to stop people from jumping the stile,” said Ke’Mon Chapman, a subway rider.

The MTA said the guards are a deterrent and they will not make arrests, however they may call the police.

MTA’s fare-free bus program slated to end in Queens this week – QNS,2024-08-29 13:00:45-04:00,"Sign up for our QNS email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

The fare-free program for a busy Queens bus line is ending this week. On Saturday, Aug. 31, the fare-free bus pilot program for the Q4 will end, with fare collection resuming on Sept. 1.

The Q4 bus service runs between Linden Boulevard and 235th Street in Cambria Heights and Archer Avenue/Parsons Boulevard in Jamaica.

Green signs have been placed at Q4 bus stop routes to notify residents of the service change.

The Q4 bus route was one of five bus routes included in a citywide fare-free pilot program that began in September 2023. The Bx18A/B, B60, M116, Q4 and S46/96 went fare-free to study how lack of fare affected ridership. The free program ends for all lines that were part of the pilot program on Aug. 31.

During the duration of the program, residents could board the fare-free buses without paying, and bus stops servicing the particular routes had signs to indicate the change. Residents using Access-A-Ride beginning and ending a trip within three-quarters of a mile of the select fare-free bus routes also had fare-free rides. The program collectively served over 43,900 daily weekday riders across each borough.

The free program was created as part of Gov. Hochul’s Fiscal Year 2024 Budget, which made additional investments in transit, including increased subway service on weekdays, middays, weeknights and weekends. Program routes were selected based on varying factors, including ridership, fare evasion, service adequacy, equity for low-income communities and accessibility to commercial sites and jobs, per the governor’s statement introducing the program in July 2023.",https://qns.com/2024/08/mta-fare-free-bus-program-end-queens-this-week/

NEW YORK (WABC) -- It could soon cost more to take the subway and bus in New York City.

The MTA proposed an increase to the subway and bus fare to $2.90 by Labor Day.

It is a 15-cent increase from the current $2.75 base fare and the first fare hike since 2019. It's also the first time the base subway and bus fare would have gone up since 2015.

""A lot of the stations are still dirty,"" rider John Delaruz said. ""They are not in commission as often. I don't see the benefit in raising the price right now.""

Weekly MetroCards would increase a dollar to $34 and 30-day MetroCards would go up $5 to $132.

Express bus fare would increase a quarter to $7 and seven-day bus passes would increase $2 to $64.

This year's planned fare hike will be closer to the standard 4% increase, which is typically how much the fare goes up every other year, instead of 5.5% originally floated, thanks to Governor Kathy Hochul's budget.

However, a planned 5.5% toll revenue increase remains in place.

""This allows us to go back to sort of our bi-annual fare and toll increase which is very important for the long-term stability of the MTA,"" said Jal Patel, MTA Deputy Chief Financial Officer.

Subway ridership just recently rebounded to about four million riders a day, but that's still more than a million fewer riders than pre-pandemic, and the agency also estimates they're losing $500 million a year to fare evasion.

Straphangers were less than pleased with the proposed hike.

""If that's what they feel they have to do, I understand,"" commuter Kevin Weaver said. ""I can't afford it. I am sorry, I mean, I love you but I'll be walking.""

Even Executive Director of the MTA's Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee Lisa Daglian acknowledged that fare hikes are necessary to keep the transit system rolling.

""Improving the discount options for riders across the system, ensuring there is equity across increases so that those who can least afford them have access to more options is critical,"" Daglian said. ""That includes raising eligibility to fair fares to 200% of the federal poverty level from the current 100% level.""

There was no fare increase in 2021 due to the pandemic.

In addition to buses and subways, fares on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North would also go up by about 4%, while keeping the $500 cap on any monthly pass.

The MTA also anticipates that with congestion pricing, more commuters will want to take the subway and commuter rail.

Officials unveiled two possible scenarios for drivers. One rewards E-Z Pass users with a 6% increase, vs a 10% increase for tolls by mail. The other spreads the pain, with a 7% increase for both E-Z Pass and toll-by-mail users.

Public hearings will be held in June and the board will vote in July, allowing fare hikes to go into effect by September.

"Watch this space: MTA piloting CCTV screens on city buses to deter assaults, fare evasion",2024-03-25 16:50:45-04:00,"Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

The MTA is piloting retail-style closed circuit television (CCTV) monitors on city buses, aiming to deter fare evasion, assaults, and other crimes by more explicitly showing riders they’re actions are being recorded.

More than 100 buses will be outfitted with the screens commonly seen at grocery stores and pharmacies, the MTA revealed on Monday. They come as the transit agency estimates that more than a third of bus riders do not pay the fare, and as transit workers reel from a series of high-profile assaults on MTA employees.

“Our bus fleet has robust camera coverage, and these pilot screens will be a force multiplier to the safety benefits these cameras already provide,” said Rich Davey, president of MTA New York City Transit.

The cameras will be installed on buses along routes with the highest rates of assaults against drivers, and will run under a pilot program through the beginning of 2025.

MTA officials often say that the transit system has more surveillance cameras than a “Las Vegas casino,” but feel that the screens may make it clearer to would-be bad actors that they are being watched.

Crime in the transit system was down 15% in February compared to the same month last year, according to NYPD Transit Chief Michael Kemper, though major felonies were up 12.5% for the first two months of 2024 as compared to last year. Arrests this year are up nearly 50% compared to the same period in 2023.

MTA’s New Anti-Fare Evasion Turnstile Strategy,2023-07-18 12:39:44-04:00,"Sign up for our amNewYork email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

The MTA is planning to reconfigure its subway turnstiles to prevent a phenomenon where they’re pulled back in the reverse direction, enabling a fare evader to slip through without paying.

The agency has already adjusted the mechanics of 26 turnstiles to prevent the maneuver, which has been dubbed “back-cocking,” and plans to upgrade another 240 this summer. The remaining 3,479 turnstiles throughout the system will receive the modification over the next two years, at a cost the MTA pegs at $2 million. However, the investment will prevent more than $45 million in estimated losses from fare evasion using the technique, according to New York City Transit’s subways chief Demetrius Crichlow.

“Even if we get a portion of that back, it will save the company a ton of money,” Crichlow said at the MTA’s Transit Committee meeting on Monday. “It definitely works, it stops them. It doesn’t stop them from seeking other means of fare evading, but it definitely does stop the back-cocking.”

The MTA has already modified some turnstiles at the Bowling Green station, just outside MTA Headquarters in lower Manhattan. A video displayed at the committee meeting showed a man attempting to back-cock multiple turnstiles but failing to slide through.

Fare evasion on subways cost the MTA $285 million last year. However, the fare evaders not only got through by back-cocking but through other means, such as jumping over the turnstiles and through emergency exit gates that are often propped open.

The agency is also looking at placing “fins” on turnstiles and fare arrays that would make them harder to hop over, said Crichlow. The agency is also trying to restrict access to its emergency exit gates: over 1,600 access keys have been yanked from MTA employees, copies of which were easily obtainable, and now only the Fire Department has access to them.

MTA executives are also seeking a variance from the state allowing the implementation of a delay between someone pushing the emergency exit door from inside the system, and it actually opening.

An internal report from earlier this year recommended, among other things, the MTA fully redesign the fare array with higher, middle-out turnstiles that are more difficult to jump. While such gates are common in other systems — and a number of engineering firms put their designs on public display earlier this year — the redesign process is still in its infancy.

On buses, where fare evasion is an even bigger problem at $315 million annually, the agency is identifying “bus stop hubs” where multiple lines come together and preparing to deploy “Eagle” teams that deter riders from entering without paying the fare.

MTA hires private security guards to crack down on fare evasion,2022-10-27 00:00:00,"The MTA has hired private security guards to help crack down on fare beaters at some stations, New York City Transit President Richard Davey said during an MTA board meeting Wednesday.

Davey said the initiative has been successful thus far.

""Across those six stations, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in fares being paid in just the last six to eight weeks,” Davey said Wednesday. “This is something we're going to scale across the system to not only provide more eyes and ears for more security purposes, but also to see if we could continue to push on fare evasion in the system.""

The Tragic Inevitability of Overpolicing New York’s Subways,2024-09-19 11:30:45,"Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.

On Sunday, two New York City police officers fired into a crowded Brooklyn subway station, shooting and injuring four people, including two bystanders, one of whom is a hospital employee now in critical condition after police shot him in the head during his commute.

The catalyst for this bloody confrontation: an alleged fare evasion. In other words, $2.90.

According to the NYPD, officers suspected that 37-year-old Derell Mickles had skipped a turnstile at the Sutter Avenue subway station in Brooklyn. The officers followed Mickles, resulting in a chase that ended with officers shooting him, two bystanders, and another officer on duty. While police initially claimed that they had recovered a knife Mickles had used to threaten officers, officials later contradicted their own claim, prompting questions over what exactly had happened.

Asked about body camera footage on Tuesday, Mayor Eric Adams deflected, telling a reporter to “speak with the police commissioner,” before praising the officers involved in Sunday’s shooting for demonstrating a “great level of restraint.” The NYPD has since firmly defended the officers, with the police departments chief of patrol stating, “We are not perfect.”

The violent incident, inside one of the world’s busiest subway systems, has sparked outrage among New Yorkers as well as a victim’s family members, who condemned the officers’ actions as “reckless.”

And they’re far from alone. Criminal justice reform advocates are slamming what they see as an outsized response by the NYPD to something as minor and trivial as alleged fare evasion. It comes amid New York Mayor Eric Adams’ aggressive crackdown on fare evaders, a policy Adams has claimed would also help with violence that occurs on trains. Protests have since broken out across the city, calling for the officers involved in Sunday’s shooting to be held accountable.

I spoke with Michael Sisitzky, assistant policy director at the New York City Civil Liberties Union, to learn more about Adams’ crackdown on fare evasion, overpolicing, and lack of police transparency surrounding Sunday’s violent encounter. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

This is an ongoing investigation. But there are already significant concerns over how the police handled this situation and how the mayor has responded.

This disturbing incident is sadly not surprising, given what we’ve seen from this administration. The Adams administration and NYPD have been dramatically ramping up enforcement activity, increasing their presence in the subways, increasing stops, increasing frisks, and increasing all of the hallmarks of broken windows policing. This is a predictable and inevitable consequence of this administration’s approach to a very aggressive enforcement mindset. There are so many questions about what we’ve heard from the mayor’s office from the NYPD about what exactly unfolded.

We have heard officer accounts of what happened. We’ve heard some witness accounts. The NYPD and the mayor’s office have been reviewing body camera footage. But, we have not been able to see this. We’re not getting a transparent accounting of what took place. It’s absolutely critical that we see the evidence that they’re relying on to make these assertions.

We’re being asked to take the word of a mayor whose initial tweet in response to this incident had to get community noted because it was leaving out the important context of the officer he was talking about having been shot was shot by a fellow officer. We can’t really trust their version of events when they’re not showing us the evidence of what took place in that incident.

This is a predictable and inevitable consequence of this administration’s approach to a very aggressive enforcement mindset.

Are complaints over transparency from the NYPD common?

It’s a hallmark of the NYPD. We know that they can be transparent when they choose to be and when they think it serves their interest. Folks may remember back in January of 2024 the NYPD released body camera footage within hours, within a day of the traffic stop of a city council member when they sought to use that footage to highlight their version of what took place. But they treat incidents like this very differently.

How common—or rare—are shootings like this in New York?

I don’t know that we have the full stats on how common this type of shooting is in the subway from an officer. It’s not something that I’ve seen a full accounting of, but what we have seen are increased reports of police misconduct and abuse of New Yorkers that have upticked with this administration. Civilian complaints going into the Civilian Complaint Review Board have reached alarmingly high levels. At the same time, there have also been real concerns about what the department is actually doing with complaints that are moving through the NYPD disciplinary system, where they’re just not taking those reports seriously.

When you respond to everything with an officer, you are increasing the likelihood that we’re going to see more cases where someone is subject to use of force.

Can overpolicing backfire? How do outsize police presences affect communities, particularly communities of color?

The approach that this administration has taken since day one is overpolicing.

They’ve identified police officers as the be-all, end-all, sole solution to every societal ill. Fare evasion? Send a cop after it. Homelessness? Send police to conduct sweeps. Mental health crises? Instead of sending peers and EMTs, send a cop instead.

It’s a formula that this administration seems wedded to, but it’s not improving community safety for New Yorkers. Police are primarily concerned with enforcing criminal laws, making arrests, and issuing summonses. They have an enforcement mindset, not a delivery of services or addressing root causes mindset.

So when you respond to everything with an officer, you are increasing the likelihood that we’re going to see more and more cases where someone is subject to use of force, someone is tased, someone is shot, someone is killed when they did not need to be, because you are responding to a situation with tools that are just fundamentally not a good fit for that scenario.

We see this play out largely in communities that need more investments to address the root causes of crime, poverty, homelessness, the need for increased mental health and healthcare services. Rather than making those investments, which are harder and will take more thought to accomplish, we instead default to a reliance on police officers.

In March, the NYPD announced they would send 800 officers into subways to combat fare evasion. In the same month, Gov. Kathy Hochul deployed the National Guard in response to several violent incidents that occurred a few weeks prior. Realistically, how effective are methods like this in preventing crime, and what are some of the pitfalls?

It’s brought up time and time again that if you focus on low-level crime and low-level signs of disorder, you’re mitigating the potential for it to escalate into more serious criminal activity and driving down overall crime rates as a result.

That’s been studied and debunked numerous times. New York City hit historically low crime rates as stop and frisk plummeted to historic lows and was reined in as enforcement fell, as summonses and arrest activity went down. The data is just not there to justify the approach to broken windows or quality-of-life policing.

Instead, it’s very effective at funneling more and more people into the criminal legal system, saddling people with fines that they cannot afford, making them attend court dates that they cannot afford, and giving people the potentially lifelong consequence of acquiring a criminal record which can extend to every aspect of their life. What it’s not doing is meeting community needs and making New Yorkers safer.

Eric Adams has pushed for a crackdown on fare evasion. Last month, the MTA announced that they’ll be sending summons of up to $50 to $100 to fare evaders. Did a “tough on crime” approach play into what happened over the weekend?

What happened over the weekend is an inevitable outcome of that kind of tough-on-crime approach, where the only tool that we seem to have to offer is police officers, who are going to focus on enforcement and if they’re given an aggressive mandate to enforce, are going to enforce that aggressively.

We haven’t seen the actual footage yet. We’re relying on accounts of what happened. But it’s very easy to see how a police officer pursuing someone, chasing them, is a tactic that is escalatory, as opposed to thinking of ways we can tackle issues like fare evasion without the threat of violence.

That is such a mismatch we don’t need to be constrained thinking about responding to fare evasion with just a police law enforcement tool.

We should be thinking more broadly about getting people access to the support they need to enroll in programs for New Yorkers who can’t afford to pay for fares to get to work, pay for child care, or get access to medical care. We can think about other ways that we are addressing those causes without putting armed officers in and telling them you need to make sure that you are aggressively cracking down on everyone within the system.

As this case has gained traction on social media, one of the most disturbing responses I’ve seen is how so many people justify using this level of force because Mickles was suspected of evading a $2.90 fare. It’s a narrative that oftentimes rears its head after a high-profile case of police brutality. We saw this with George Floyd, Eric Garner.

The level of force used here is so disproportionate to the alleged infraction. No one should be subject to having their life put in jeopardy because of an alleged evasion of a $2.90 cent fare, to say nothing of the fact that officers pursued him into a crowded station and onto a train.

That response is not only out of proportion to the individual’s alleged offense, but it is putting so many other people needlessly in harm’s way.

It’s deeply disturbing that the NYPD and the administration could view that level of a response as an appropriate reaction when we’re talking about something as trivial as the evasion of a $2.90 cent fare.

Since the shooting occurred, plenty of New Yorkers have started to protest the NYPD’s crackdown on fare evasion. What are your thoughts on some of these demonstrations?

People are recognizing an uptick in the targeting of their communities and an uptick in stop activity racial disparities as bad or even worse than they were at its height. There is a real sense that the NYPD is not providing a service to New Yorkers but is causing active harm In communities.

And I think that an expression that also finds a voice in the number of complaints of police misconduct going in, being on the rise, and is evident in the types of protests that we’re seeing against this incident and against other instances of police brutality and violence.

It’s important that New Yorkers be able to express their to raise their voice and express their views in protesting against policies that are causing harm in their communities rather than actually helping deliver real safety for them.",https://www.motherjones.com/criminal-justice/2024/09/nypd-subway-shooting-derell-mickles-overpolicing/
Big Cities Crank Up Enforcement to Collect Dwindling Transit Fares,2023-04-12 05:01:54.967000,"In Brief: Many big-city transit agencies are spending money to upgrade fare-collection systems and crack down on fare evasion.

Data tracking on evasion rates varies widely from agency to agency.

In some cases, fare enforcement has as much to do with emphasizing social order on trains and buses as it has to do with revenue.

Philadelphia's transit system, known as SEPTA, which did not respond to emails and phone calls, recently approved nearly $1 million to buy 22 new fare gates for just two subway stations in Center City, according to a report in The Philadelphia Inquirer. The agency estimates it lost more than $22 million to fare evasion since last July, the report says.

The agency estimates it lost more than $22 million to fare evasion since last July, the report says. A spokesperson for the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) said it was “impossible to accurately know how many people avoid paying fares and what the cost of that may be,” but noted that the agency was spending $2 million on new fare gates that will be harder to pass without paying. CTA, which does not have its own police force, also doubled the number of Chicago Police Department officers and other security personnel over the last year, including K-9 security forces at station entrances, the spokesperson said.

Bay Area Rapid Transit doesn’t have any recent estimates of how much revenue is lost to fare evasion, a spokesperson said, but in some years before the pandemic the agency estimated the loss was between $15 million and $25 million annually. BART is moving forward with a $90 million plan to install new fare gates, which, according to a project description, will have “clear swing barriers that will be very difficult to be pushed through, jumped over or maneuvered under.”

How To Maximize Payment

Fare evasion by turnstile jumpers not only reduces revenue, but it also contributes to a pervasive sense that riding transit is no longer orderly or safe and should be avoided. The result is a further loss in ridership and revenue for transit authorities. (Shutterstock)

Avoiding Over-Policing

A million here, $90 million there, and pretty soon you’re talking real money.As big-city transit systems work to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, they’re anticipating a long-term plateau of lower ridership and sharply reduced fare revenue. The gloomy financial outlook has caused agencies around the country to cancel long-planned capital projects and consider cutting daily service.At the same time, agencies are spending new money — lots of it, in some cases — to crack down on fare evasion with new fare gates, updated collection systems and beefed-up policing. Even as fares shrink overall, some agencies feel they need to show they’re collecting every fare they can, not just to ward off financial disaster but also to address a sense of lawlessness — real and perceived — on buses and trains. But when do the costs of enforcement outweigh the benefits?There’s no standard method of tracking fare evasion across transit systems with widely varying payment systems. Most agencies don’t seem to know with any confidence how widespread the problem is. But there’s a broad sense that fare jumping increased during the pandemic, especially after some riders got used to not paying when agencies waived fares in the early days of the outbreak.The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) in Washington, D.C., made its most recent estimate of fare evasion in February 2022, and it was a doozy: Some 34 percent of Metrobus riders weren’t paying fares that year, up from 14 percent in Fiscal Year 2019 and 17 percent in FY 2020. Evasion reduced the agency’s revenue by $10 million in FY 2022.“Fare evasion is a major issue,” WMATA wrote in a performance report published earlier this year, which estimated that 13 percent of Metrorail riders and up to 51 percent of Metrobus riders hadn’t paid their fare during the first six months of FY 2023. Like other agencies, WMATA is facing a daunting fiscal cliff when federal relief funds run out next year. But it’s still moving ahead with a fare gate modification project, with higher gates designed to deter jumping, at an estimated cost of up to $40 million.Other agencies are buying new gates too.What’s the ideal fare-evasion rate? It’s probably not zero percent, says Alon Levy, a fellow in the Transportation and Land Use program of the NYU Marron Institute. From a revenue perspective, the goal shouldn’t be to eliminate fare evasion, but to maximize fare revenue “net of” the costs of collection, Levy says. When fare enforcement becomes too expensive, the returns start to diminish.Levy, who is based in Berlin, says transit agencies can maximize fare collection by minimizing the “friction” involved in payment. “ Proof of payment ” systems in which riders buy their tickets ahead of time, and tickets are randomly checked by enforcement officers, tend to be the smoothest, they say.In many European metro systems, the vast majority of riders are monthly pass holders, Levy says, and that’s partly because the cost per ride is lower than it is on many American metros. Fares are often better integrated between metro trains and buses than they are in the U.S. as well, they say. A monthly passholder in Berlin has to take 36 rides in order to justify the cost of the pass, Levy says, whereas in New York City, it takes 46 rides to cover the monthly cost.New York has had a rocky history with fare jumping, with a recent surge in arrests for fare evasion on the MTA. In 2019, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed hiring an additional 500 MTA police officers at a cost of $249 million over four years, partly to collect lost fare revenue that only added up to $200 million over the same period. MTA created a task force last year to combat fare evasion on the system. MTA representatives declined to answer questions about evasion rates and enforcement costs, pending the release of a strategic plan for fare enforcement in the next few weeks.Fare evasion isn’t the driving cause of transit systems’ budget woes in the wake of the pandemic. But many feel that in order to bring more paying riders back, they have to crack down on fare jumping as part of a broader effort to restore a sense of social order on buses and trains. A recent report in thepainted an apocalyptic picture of drug abuse and lawlessness pushing riders away from the L.A. Metro. Minnesota lawmakers recently backed a plan for a Transit Service Intervention Project on the Minneapolis system, which would enlist “state and local police and social workers along with nonprofit mental illness and homelessness advocates to ‘reset the culture’ of expectations of train users,” according to a report.Many of the issues transit systems are facing today, from drug abuse on buses and trains to unhoused people congregating in stations and public areas, go back decades, says Dorothy Schulz, an adjunct fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute and a retired transit police officer who once led the Metro-North command at Grand Central Terminal. Agencies have responded in many cases with hostile architecture and design choices, including a total lack of seating in New York’s new Moynihan Train Hall. Fare evasion doesn’t just directly deprive agencies of money, but it may also contribute to a sense of disorder that drives paying riders away, Schulz says.Chris Van Eyken, the director of research and policy at TransitCenter, agrees. “I think there is an overall sense that fare evasion is contagious,” Van Eyken says. “When [riders and transit workers] see people jumping the turnstile, it makes them feel like there’s a lack of order on the system and maybe it’s not as safe as it could be.”Transit agencies are right to want to collect as much fare revenue as they can, but they should minimize the role of police in the process, Van Eyken says. Sound Transit in Seattle recently chose to permanently implement a pilot program that uses unarmed “ambassadors” to conduct fare enforcement rather than police. L.A. Metro also recently deployed 300 ambassadors to play a sort of support and security role on the transit system as well.At times, the cost of enforcement may push the boundaries of a typical cost-benefit analysis. And fare enforcement shouldn’t necessarily be a top priority for transit systems as they face down the fiscal cliff. But those systems that have fares feel they owe it to their paying riders, and to the government authorities that subsidize them, that they’re not just giving scofflaws a free ride, Van Eyken says.“Agencies like to get across the message that they’re making people pay the fare they’ve set, and their riders and funders like to see that too,” he says. “It’s understandable that sometimes it’s not purely a financial consideration.”",https://www.governing.com/community/big-cities-crank-up-enforcement-to-collect-dwindling-transit-fares

MTA looks to redesign subway turnstiles to crack down on rampant farebeating,2022-12-05 00:00:00,"The MTA wants to redesign subway turnstiles and emergency exit gates — the “superhighway” for deadbeats — to crack down on fare evasion, CEO Janno Lieber said Monday.

“We have to change the physical turnstile,” Lieber said at a breakfast hosted by the Manhattan Institute.

“The exit gate — which is nominally supposed to be for fire, exiting purposes, to comply with the fire code — has become the superhighway for fare evasion.”

In May, Lieber said the MTA was on track to lose $500 million to fare evasion this year.

To address the issue, the appointee of Gov. Kathy Hochul formed a “blue ribbon panel” to study solutions. The group has yet to release its findings.

But new designs — likely to require significant financial investment — are one proposal expected to come out of the panel’s work, an MTA spokesman said.

In San Francisco, Bay Area Rapid Transit has budgeted $90 million to install gates that people “can’t push through, jump over or maneuver under,” according to the agency’s website.

A new turnstile is just one part of the effort that’s so far included both armed and unarmed security guards to patrol fare machines and turnstiles, increased NYPD enforcement and behind-the-scenes collaboration with local prosecutors, Lieber said.

Most subway riders pay the required $2.75 fare. J. Messerschmidt/NY Post

Prosecutors across 13 counties also need to have the same approach to fare evasion enforcement, Lieber said. That hasn’t happened yet.

“We are working with DAs on this. We want to have a consensus fare evasion enforcement policy,” Lieber said. “There’s no secret there’s ideological range in some of our New York City and suburban DAs.”

NYPD fare enforcement has jumped 97% this year compared to last. J. Messerschmidt/NY Post

NYPD fare enforcement, meanwhile, jumped 97% this year compared with last, NYPD Transit Bureau Chief Jason Wilcox said last week.

Lieber has claimed transit criminals are “overwhelmingly” fare beaters, though he hasn’t provided statistics to back that up.

Fare evasion spiked on both buses and subways since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fare beaters accounted for 29.3% of bus riders during July, August and September, according to the MTA — up from 29.1% during the first three months of the year.

Subway fare evasion also rose, according to data: 9.8% of riders were deadbeats at the end of 2021. According to the most recent survey, 13.4% of riders now do the same.",https://nypost.com/2022/12/05/mta-looks-to-redesign-subway-turnstiles-to-fight-fare-beating/
LIRR is right to crack down on fare evasion,2024-07-10 18:52:12.232000+00:00,"The Long Island Rail Road's effort to set up a gating system at Penn Station — even as a pilot program — represents one of the railroad's clearest and loudest signals to freeloading riders: Pay up.

While the system has only been in place several times a week, it's a valuable experiment that appears to be working. Hopefully, it will result in far better fare collections, while keeping the trains safer for passengers and conductors. If it works, it should be made permanent at Penn, and considered for other high-traffic spots in the LIRR system.

Gating isn't new for the LIRR, but in the past was only deployed at large events at Citi Field, Forest Hills Stadium or UBS Arena. Gating for daily rush-hour trains will take time and effort but may be one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce the persistent fare-evasion problem, which causes losses of about $700 million a year across the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, including $24 million on the LIRR.

There are kinks to resolve, and this effort will not replace the traditional role of conductors checking tickets on trains. In the moments before a train departs and the gating stops, the LIRR may end up allowing through some fare beaters. The conductors must still be sure to catch them once on board. And the LIRR should evaluate the new system for its impact on personnel safety, efficiency and performance.

The gating strategy should be part of a more comprehensive fare evasion solution. The LIRR's past effort to give non-payers IOUs didn't work; when no identification was required, just 5% of invoices were paid. A single fare-beater absurdly racked up $2,154 in tickets, receiving 155 invoices in six months.

The LIRR's recent change — in which conductors issue IOUs only to those riders who provide identification, and remove riders who can't pay and don't provide ID — may be more successful. MTA Police's expanded presence on the trains is key. Also important: The LIRR should use all technology at its disposal to target repeat offenders and to otherwise improve fare collection.

Fares go toward the MTA's operating budget, making these efforts especially important as the agency attempts to address a capital budget hole dug by the pause in the plan to impose vehicle tolls in Manhattan.

Efforts like gating at Penn Station and removing nonpaying riders from trains should have a critical impact on rider perception. Riders who do pay will feel safer, riders who don't may be less likely to continue their evasions. The LIRR must try every effort to stop this behavior.",https://www.newsday.com/opinion/editorials/lirr-mta-fare-evasion-long-island-rail-road-ijy7ye2r

NEW YORK CITY — A simple ""hack"" is all it takes to beat the MTA's fancy new anti-fare evasion gates, according to a viral video.

MTA officials, in response, said the gates are only tactic in their fight against turnstile jumpers. “The MTA has a multi-layered approach to deterring fare evasion, driven by a blue-ribbon panel’s report, that includes a search for new fare gate technology, police officers, private guards, transit enforcement teams, discount fare programs and soon, a customer-messaging campaign,"" said Tim Minton, the MTA's communications director, in a statement.",https://patch.com/new-york/queens/hack-bypasses-mtas-fancy-new-anti-fare-evasion-gates-video

and is not using it to identify riders, an agency spokesperson said. As for the LIRR, the MTA says it has no plans to bring the same technology to it.

Although the report did not explain how the technology works, the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (S.T.O.P.), a New York-based privacy and civil rights group, last week released the MTA’s contract with Spanish technology firm Awaait Artificial Intelligence. It explained how the “video analytics fare evasion software” combines streamed video and actual fare “swipe data” made available by the MTA to zero-in on fare beaters.

The software even keeps tabs on the fare beaters' preferred methods: “jumping over turnstile, passing underneath turnstile, swinging the turnstile tripods arms back and forth, reverse entering at the emergency gates,” according to the contract.

The amount paid by the MTA for the technology is redacted in the documents obtained by S.T.O.P. MTA officials would not disclose the cost of the contract.

'A COUNTING TOOL'

In a statement, MTA communications director Tim Minton said the MTA is using the technology “as a counting tool” and is not using it to identify riders.

“The objective is to determine how many people are evading the fare and how are they doing it,” Minton said.

Still, subway rider Malcolm Combs, 23, said learning that the MTA is using A.I. to track fare beaters makes him feel ""just a little bit"" uneasy.

""You just never know what they use it for . . . I feel like it's kind of a gateway, if you allow it,"" said Combs, of Bayside, who questioned the MTA's newly intensified focus on fare evasion. ""I don't see it a lot, and I don't know if I'd say it's something that really bothers me, because they plan on raising the prices [of fares] and you just never know what somebody is going through.""

Asked if there were any plans to bring technology to the LIRR, MTA spokesperson Joana Flores said that because it works on fare gates, it could not be used on a commuter railroad like the LIRR, where riders have their fares validated once on board a train.

Still, Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of S.T.O.P., said he believes “at a time when every surveillance camera is just one software upgrade from being turned into a facial recognition tool, and with more and more cameras across the LIRR, there’s a good risk that this pilot might extend to the LIRR in the future.”

“We know that surveillance creep tends to start in New York City, but it definitely doesn’t stop there,” Cahn said. “We’ve definitely seen a lot of the surveillance programs expand onto Long Island in recent years.”

Cahn said he envisions the LIRR one day using facial recognition software to scan passengers as they board a train, so that past fare evaders could be “flagged” for authorities. MTA officials said they are not using facial recognition technology in their subway fare evasion A.I. program.

""The MTA uses this tool to quantify the amount of fare evasion without identifying fare evaders,"" Flores said.

CAMERAS ON LIRR TRAINS, AT STATIONS

The LIRR began installing cameras on its trains in 2014, and as of last September has them in place throughout 90% of its fleet. The railroad has also included the installation of security cameras in recent renovation projects of several Long Island stations, including New Hyde Park and Carle Place.

Privacy concerns have abounded even as elected officials have increasingly embraced surveillance technology and artificial intelligence as tools to secure the transit system. Following a mass shooting on a Brooklyn subway train in April of last year, New York City Mayor Eric Adams advocated for the use of “innovative technology” to detect weapons in the transit system.

In September, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced an initiative to increase the use of cameras on subway cars and stations, dismissing naysayers by pointing out that if “you walk into any grocery store, you're being watched.""

""So, [if] you think 'Big Brother' is watching you on the subways, you're absolutely right,” Hochul added. “If you're concerned about this, the best answer is: Don't commit any crimes on the subways.""",https://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/mta-lirr-ai-artificial-intelligence-surveillance-lqz1iyc1
Hochul has yet another chance at redemption by solving NYC’s fare-beating crisis,2024-08-27 00:00:00,"The broken-windows theory of social disorder holds that minor problems that go unaddressed will grow into major problems.

The namesake example argues that a vacant building with a single broken window will soon have many broken windows as well as other problems and become a dangerous neighborhood blight.

That’s the idea, and now comes the latest example of real-life proof.

This one involves riders refusing to pay the fare on New York City buses.

A mind-boggling 48% of all bus passengers are guilty of fare-beating, costing the MTA hundreds of millions of dollars a year, the agency says.

True to the theory, the number of cheaters didn’t make the leap in one year.

It started as a manageable problem but grew quickly because nothing was done to stop it.

The evasion figure stood at 18% of riders in 2018, grew to 33% in May 2023 and then hit 41% last December.

Nearly half hop stiles

Now nearly one out of every two riders doesn’t pay.

Subway fare evasion, which is more difficult because of turnstiles, stands at a reported 14%, still high by international standards.

Worse, the rate of growth will continue to explode as more and more honest riders see that there is no penalty for not paying, leading many of them to join the cheaters.

As the broken-windows theory long ago proved, the lack of consequences serves as an invitation for more trouble.

The financial losses already are astronomical.

Bus cheaters cost the MTA $312 million in 2022 alone, and the agency’s total loss from bus and subway fare evasion in 2023 was some $700 million.

Eventually, nobody will pay — except taxpayers.

The MTA, Albany and City Hall bemoan the problem but have done next to nothing to stop it.

They’ve tried a few half-hearted measures, but nothing that would actually stem the tide.

The latest effort involves unarmed “fare inspectors” who can ask cheaters to get off a bus or issue a ticket for up to $100.

But there are only about 100 of them on the job, The Post reports, showing how unserious the agency is about fixing the massive problem.

In fact, the measure is typical of the government’s eagerness to go woke, even when it means going broke.

As the New York Times reports, in 2017, then-Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. stopped treating subway turnstile jumpers as a criminal matter.

His office said it was part of a plan “to reduce inequality and unnecessary incarceration by ending the prosecution of low-level, non-violent offenses.”

DAs fuel lawlessness

Other prosecutors soon followed, and the COVID outbreak, along with the George Floyd riots, started a chain reaction of lawlessness that continues.

It’s been fueled by pro-criminal, far-left legislators and so-called prosecutors who flash the green light to all sorts of violations by downgrading or eliminating penalties.

A glaring illustration is that Alvin Bragg, Vance’s successor, has taken his example of avoiding criminal penalties for fare-beating and extended it to other areas.

One result of the decriminalization movement, which is a twin sickness of defunding the police, is the explosion of shoplifting, which is causing retail store closures, large job losses and neighborhood decline.

Albany even tied judges’ hands, with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie suggesting too many judges are racists and their decisions about which criminal suspects to detain can’t be trusted.

His ultimate aim seems to be to turn ’em all loose.

Yet this being New York, nothing is so bad that it can’t be made worse.

And so it is with the political response to fare-beating, which is revealing the cynicism and cowardice of the ruling class.

Enter congestion pricing, which was advertised as a supposed social good but was also a backdoor way to finance the MTA as the fare-beating losses soared.

Instead of using their power to penalize the thieves in ways that would act as a deterrent, Gov. Kathy Hochul, Mayor Eric Adams and lawmakers in Albany and City Hall want to cover the deficit by taxing commuters and trucks, with plans calling for the agency to reap about $1 billion a year.

Auto drivers would be penalized $15 a day for daring to drive into Manhattan south of 60th Street, while service and delivery trucks would pay as much as $36.

Hochul suddenly “paused” the plan weeks before the scheduled June 30 start date, but has done nothing to remove the suspicion that she acted simply to protect Democrats in this year’s elections.

Her move came soon after a visit to the White House and a reported conversation with Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn resident and House minority leader who wants to be speaker.

He called her decision “reasonable,” reflecting how unpopular congestion pricing is, especially in the suburbs, and how putting it into effect could keep the House in GOP hands.

Hochul’s belated argument — that the tax would unfairly sock workers — was always true and will remain so.

Ditto for her statement that $15 was too high.

With signs that the economy is softening and with unemployment rising, now is an especially rotten time to increase the already sky-high cost of living and working in New York.

Don’t tax — enforce!

Fortunately, there is an alternative that is not only more sensible, but also more just.

As the cost of fare-beating approaches a total similar to what congestion pricing would supposedly yield, Hochul gets a second chance to head off a big mistake.

She should mobilize the MTA and get Adams to have the NYPD make a priority of arresting fare cheats.

And she should lean on Dem prosecutors and judges to put teeth into the cases.

There is also a matter of fairness in fixing street congestion in ways that don’t penalize those who must or want to drive into Manhattan.

Anti-car zealots have been running the city’s Department of Transportation for two decades and have mucked up streets with every imaginable barrier to make driving difficult.

Pedestrian plazas, bicycle lanes, restaurant sheds, pedicabs and bike-share stations have all been given priority, forcing traffic on many streets into single lanes.

An epidemic of double-parking by delivery trucks, even during rush hours, is viewed more as a source of ticket revenue for the city than a cause of congestion.

The point is that traffic snarls can be reduced without penalizing innocent drivers and the MTA’s budget can be boosted by cracking down on the real source of its money woes — fare-beaters.

Both measures are not only right, they would also be popular.

But the clock is ticking, and if Hochul doesn’t permanently kill the congestion tax before the election, it means she intends to lift her pause and restore it afterward, when voters can’t punish her party.

On the other hand, if she eliminates the tax before November, voters will know she is acting in good faith.

Moreover, she will have demonstrated that good policy can also be good politics.",https://nypost.com/2024/08/27/opinion/hochul-has-yet-another-chance-at-redemption-by-solving-nycs-fare-beating-crisis/
LIRR considers physical barriers to combat $24M per year fare evasion,2023-05-17 20:51:46.084000+00:00,"The MTA is considering several measures to curb fare beaters on the Long Island Rail Road, including potentially setting up “physical barriers” to keep riders from boarding trains without showing their tickets.

That was among several recommendations in a report published Wednesday by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on how to address fare evasion, which costs the MTA nearly $700 million a year.

On the LIRR, $24.4 million is lost annually on unpaid fares, according to the report. It estimated that a third of all LIRR fares are either uncollected or collected incorrectly.

“We have found that fare evasion is at crisis levels across the transit system, and the problem is much bigger than everyone thinks,” Rosemonde Pierre-Louis, co-chair of the MTA’s fare evasion panel and executive director of the NYU McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research, said at an MTA news conference at Grand Central Terminal Wednesday. “Turning the tide on these sobering numbers is mission critical. And we firmly believe that action must be taken now, before the impact is irreversible.”

What to know The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is considering several measures to curb fare beaters on the Long Island Rail Road.

on unpaid fares, according to an MTA report. To address fare evasion, the report recommended exploring automatic penalties and “technology-based solutions” to the delayed activation of electronic tickets, giving police officers technology to more easily issue summonses for riders who refuse to pay fares, and looking into “the cost effectiveness and efficacy of adding physical fare control” at some of the LIRR’s busiest stations.

Different from subways, where fare beaters avoid paying at turnstiles, fare evasion on the LIRR is often more complex. Some fares go uncollected because trains are too crowded for conductors to collect tickets, or because the pricing structure is so complicated that some passengers are undercharged by ticket collectors.

The report, compiled by a panel of experts that studied the issue for a year, made several recommendations for how to address fare evasion on the LIRR. They include exploring automatic penalties, “technology-based solutions” to delayed activation of electronic tickets, giving police officers technology to more easily issue summonses for riders who refuse to pay fares, and looking into “the cost effectiveness and efficacy of adding physical fare control” at some of the LIRR’s busiest stations.

The LIRR has said a key problem has been riders putting off activating electronic tickets until a conductor comes around, hoping it won't be checked and can be used in the future.

One idea mentioned in the report is piloting a “full-scale gating” operation during the rush hours. Riders would be required to show their tickets before boarding “at a checkpoint with physical barriers” and police present.

LIRR commuter Danya Matthew expressed skepticism about the LIRR putting a new obstacle in the way of riders boarding trains.

“I don’t know how that would work,” Matthew, 53, of Brooklyn, said before boarding her train at Grand Central Madison. “Now you’re going to have a stampede around people trying to get through this barrier to get on a train. I don’t know if that’s going to go over well. I can’t see it.”

Other recommendations included reviewing ticket validity periods, considering increasing the service charge for onboard ticket purchases, and reviewing the LIRR’s pricing formula “to identify opportunities to streamline and simplify the onboard fare collection process.”

The report also recommended several changes in the way the LIRR deals with riders who refuse to pay. The LIRR’s system of giving fare beaters an invoice to be returned by mail is “clearly ineffective,” according to the report, with the railroad only collecting payment on 5% of the invoices.

The panel recommended doing away with the mail-in invoices, and coming up with an alternative that focuses on creating “customers, not criminals.” As such, the panel suggested treating fare beating on the LIRR as a crime “only in the most serious cases.” Repeat offenders would face escalating fines, while most others would receive a civil summons.

Anthony Simon, who leads the LIRR conductors’ union, criticized the MTA for “taking a soft approach” to fare evasion, rather than addressing the problem through increased police enforcement.

“Stealing is stealing,” Simon, general chairman of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers, said in a statement. “Not prioritizing policing to fix this issue, as well as implementing legislative changes to provide consequences for those who cheat the MTA, just empowers people who will continue to evade.”

The report also made several recommendations on how to address fare evasion on MTA buses and subways, including by expanding a program to offer discounted fares to low-income riders who cannot afford full fares, and by modernizing subway fare gates to make them “more evasion proof.”

The MTA pilot program, which launches Sept. 24, will offer free rides on one line in each borough for at least six months. Michelle Charlesworth has the story.

WILLIAMSBURG, Brooklyn (WABC) -- In a few days, residents in every borough will be able to take rides on a couple of New York City MTA buses for free over the next six months.

That's five free buses, totally free.

Beginning Sunday, passengers won't be charged fares on the following lines: Q4 in Queens, B60 in Brooklyn, M116 in Manhattan, S46/96 in Staten Island, and the Bx18A/B in the Bronx.

The fare-free pilot program is part of the ""Fix the MTA"" legislative package which was in the state budget.

These buses will be clearly marked ""Fare Free"" with green and black destination signage, digital signs onboard buses, decals inside the bus and covers on farebox and OMNY readers. The pilot will not include free transfers to other buses or subway lines.

State legislators say they hope to eventually make all buses and subway lines free.

""This free bus is not just a socialist dream,"" said New York State Assemblymember Phara Souffrant-Forrest to Eyewitness News. ""It's a reality to New York.""

But after the MTA said it lost $600 million last year to fare evasion - a bulk of it was on buses - did the fare evaders win?

""I do believe they caved to fare beaters,"" said one New Yorker. ""They are just afraid to enforce the law.""

There's also the anxiety that comes with the word ""free."" As this program goes into effect, will it also lead to cost of living to go up again?

""It's not a pipe dream,"" said NY State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani. ""New Jersey has an 11.5% tax rate on corporate profits. We have a 7.25% one in NY - we will tax them. This won't cost average New Yorkers a dime.""

NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams assures residents this is all a step in the right direction. ""We know in cities where they've done this, people take far fewer cars and that's what we want.""

The goal here - is eventually to make all buses and subways - free.

Independent Budget Office: Fare-Free Buses Would Cost $652M,2023-02-23 00:00:00,"The city's independent budget wonks have entered the free buses fray with an analysis of their very own — estimating the cost of eliminating bus fares to be lower than either supporters or skeptics of the proposal have suggested.

Free buses for all riders would cost the MTA $652 million annually, the Independent Budget Office wrote in a report released on Wednesday examining the cost of a bus fare jubilee.

""We estimate that the annual cost to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) associated with eliminating local bus fares — including foregone fare revenue offset partially by any associated savings — would be $652 million if fares were waived for all riders,"" IBO Assistant Director Sarah Stefanski wrote in the study, which was requested by Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Brooklyn).

The IBO is a nonpartisan, city-funded agency that analyzes and publishes information on the municipal budget.

Number crunchers from the agency pegged free buses at an even lower cost than the $778 million-per-year price tag estimated by the group of politicians backing ""Fix the MTA"" legislation in Albany to eliminate the $2.75-per-trip fee.

MTA CEO and Chairman Janno Lieber has dismissed free buses as an ""experiment"" that the cash-strapped agency can't risk at the moment, but ""Fix the MTA"" proponent Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani (D-Queens) said the IBO's analysis is proof the idea is workable.

""This is a validation of the approach that we've taken, in that it shows that ... if you allocate the money that we have asked for you'd absolutely be able to make buses free,"" said Mamdani. ""I think that this shows us that even our most ambitious ideas may actually end up costing us less than we're assuming right now.""

The $652 million estimate was based on $708 million in revenue the MTA collected from bus fares in 2022, plus $91 million in potential lost subway revenue due to a predicted four percent drop in train trips as a result of free buses.

But the IBO also predicted that the MTA would save $33 million in expenses on unneeded OMNY personnel and EAGLE fare evasion team costs — and pick up another $113 million from bus to subway trips that are still made under the free bus program.

The cost of free buses isn't as simple as subtracting the MTA's current bus revenues. Chart: IBO The cost of free buses isn't as simple as subtracting the MTA's current bus revenues. Chart: IBO

""Based on the MTA’s 2018 New York City travel survey, IBO estimates approximately 16 percent of bus trips conclude with a free subway transfer. If such trips continue to be made under fare-free bus service, the rider will enjoy a free bus ride but will then need to pay for the subsequent subway ride,"" Stefanski wrote in the study.

""The MTA would therefore make up a portion of foregone revenues in subway fares.""

Asked about free buses during an appearance on WNYC on Wednesday, MTA top dog Lieber suggested the MTA would lose ""a billion dollars"" if it enacted the policy.

Fare-free bus service would drive ridership away from subways and onto buses, and require more drivers and vehicles to serve the increased ridership, he claimed.

""I'm a little concerned about unintended consequences,"" Lieber told host Brian Lehrer. ""I think it would hit the MTA bottom-line by like a billion dollars. Not just because you wouldn't be collecting fares on buses, but also because you would have a significant shift from subway to bus, because it was free.""

""You would have to buy more buses, hire more bus drivers, yada, yada, yada. I'm concerned about unintended consequences.""

The IBO report delved into Lieber's ""yada yada yada's"" — though with slightly different assumptions.

Just 4 percent of bus trips will completely replace subway trips, Stefanski wrote — based in part on the fact that the subway is currently more reliable than the city's traffic-choked streets.

""We assume nearly all subway trips will continue, as the subway typically provides faster and more frequent service than parallel bus trips,"" she wrote.

Anticipating Lieber's concerns about needing more drivers and buses to serve the increased ridership, Stefanski said persistently low ridership since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic three years ago left plenty of room to grow.

A free bus experiment in Boston led to a 38 percent jump on one route, the report noted. That level spike would only bring the MTA back to 2019-era ridership levels, though there could be an additional impact if ridership ever exceed 2019's average of 1,770,394 per weekday.

""More detailed, route-level analysis is needed to accurately estimate the effects of increased ridership on the bus system’s operating and capital expenses,"" the report said.

If the $652 million is too much sticker shock for prospective buyers, the report used similar math to price the cost of fare-free buses for either reduced-fare MetroCard holders or Fair Fares MetroCard holders.

Providing free buses to riders over 65 or with qualifying disability currently eligible for half-priced fares would cost the MTA $40 million, the IBO said.

Doing so for the 270,000 current participants of the Fair Fares program, meanwhile, would cost $28 million, which the agency would lose $83 million in revenue if all 796,000 city residents who qualify for the program got free passes.",https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/02/23/nycs-independent-budget-crunchers-peg-cost-of-fare-free-buses-proposal-at-652-million
NYPD sending hundreds of cops into subway system to curb fare evasion,2024-03-25 16:37:11+00:00,"The New York City Police Department is dispatching another surge of officers into the city's subway system this week as part of an operation focused on stopping fare evaders.

Code named ""Operation Fare Play,"" the department is sending hundreds of officers underground to dozens of stations across the city. They'll be focusing on the turnstiles and whether people pay their fair share.

“We’re thrilled by the commitment to transit safety demonstrated again and again by Mayor Adams and the NYPD,"" MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said in a statement.

Starting Monday, riders can expect to see additional police throughout the system, at least through this week.

The latest subway deployment comes on the heels of a number of high-profile crimes in the transit system. NYPD officials say fare evasion often leads to other crimes being committed on the subway -- and this action is a direct effort to curb violence.

It's been almost two weeks since the fight on an A train in Brooklyn that led to a struggle and shots fired on the train as it rolled into the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station. Police officials have said the man shot in the head with his own gun was a fare evader.

That A train shooting came a week after Gov. Kathy Hochul flooded the transit system with 750 National Guard troops and other law enforcement personnel in a bid to curb crime.

Violence in the subway system is rare, with major crimes dropping nearly 3% from 2022 to 2023 and killings falling from 10 to five during the same span, according to police. But serious incidents have attracted attention, such as a passenger's slashing of a subway conductor in the neck last month. Three recent homicides also made headlines.

Year over year, the NYPD says subway crime is down 15.5% this month. Police credit the initial wave of officers sent into the subway system last month to conduct bag checks for helping to lower those numbers.

MTA Again Floats Back Door Boarding Once Students Get OMNY,2024-05-20 00:00:00,"MTA leaders could finally allow New York City bus riders to board through the back door, after they roll out OMNY for students later this year, officials said Monday.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has for years stalled all-door boarding by not activating the OMNY readers on almost all of its buses, fearing more fare evasion, despite the measure being key to speeding up the nation’s slowest people movers.

“Once we get most or all of the [student] population on OMNY, it is one way we could comfortably start to use the validators at the back door,” MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber told MTA board members at a committee meeting on Monday.

The MTA plans replace student MetroCards with OMNY cards in September, before transitioning to smart devices once the agency's contractor Cubic reconfigures the contactless payment software. Transportation bigs hope the upgrade will curb a spike in fare evasion — really non-swipes — that happens daily around school dismissal time, according to the agency.

“The software is not cooked for it to go onto the ... student phones yet, so this coming school year will be OMNY cards,” said Lieber. “After that, for the future, it’ll be all on the phone.

“They sometimes struggle to find their MetroCard, but they know where their phone is,” he added.

The MTA press office declined to provide a more detailed schedule for activating back-door OMNY readers.

Advocates have long yearned for all-door boarding as one of the main benefits of modernizing the city's fare-payment system, but the effort has been delayed repeatedly. Lieber has dismissed the benefits of all-door boarding as a “hypothesis,” but the approach has shortened bus loading and unload times at many more advanced bus systems — including on the MTA’s own Select Bus Service, which has offered back-door boarding for 16 years.

Former New York City Transit President Andy Byford promised all-door boarding six years ago when he launched his “bus action plan” to turn around the Big Apple’s beleaguered surface transit system.

For now, bus boosters were cautiously optimistic, but wary that MTA bigs will find another excuse to hold off on the crucial upgrade.

“It’s better late than never,” said Danny Pearlstein of the advocacy group Riders Alliance. “But we’ve heard promises like these before, and given the ongoing challenges with OMNY, it’s all too easy to see another delay on that side being used to further delay all-door boarding.”

City students currently get MetroCards with a limited number of daily trips, and some don’t swipe into the transit system because they think “it’s free anyway,” according to the “Blue Ribbon Panel on MTA Fare and Toll Evasion,” from a year ago.

“Fare evasion is its highest right after school gets out around three o’clock,” NYC Transit President Richard Davey said last month, citing data on subway fare evasion from the panel's report. “One of our hypotheses is actually fares aren’t being evaded [but] students aren’t swiping.”

But if students are not swiping, other straphangers may be encouraged to do the same, said Lisa Daglian, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, an in-house rider advocacy arm of the MTA.

“It’s not free, you’re enabling other people to also evade the fare,” said Daglian. “That’s the opportunistic fare evader.”

The MTA deployed OMNY readers to all buses by late 2020, but has stubbornly refused to turn them on at the rear doors, forcing riders to line up at the front. The agency floated a modest pilot on 10 routes in 2021, but then mothballed it fearing it would harm the recovery of revenue collection on buses, which went fare-free for nine months earlier on in the pandemic and continue to have higher rates of unpaid fares than the subways.

Allowing riders to board at the back also encourages more people to switch to OMNY, Pearlstein said.

“The best incentive would have been opening up the back door to everyone using OMNY,” he said. “There’s no reason not to provide that to riders just because some people are not paying the fare. It isn’t fair to the millions of people who ride the bus every day.”",https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/20/mta-again-floats-back-door-boarding-once-students-get-omny

We’re on a mission to change that. Our work has already shown what can happen when those with power know that someone is watching, with stories that have prompted policy changes and spurred legislation. We have ambitious plans for the rest of the year and beyond, including tackling new beats and more hard-hitting stories — but we need your help to make them a reality.

HALF of all Bronx bus passengers are fare-dodging,2022-02-22 14:47:58+00:00,"Fare evaders now account for a third of all bus trips taken in NYC, with half of all trips in the Bronx taken for free and the scam costing the MTA $56m in just three months.

The latest fare evasion survey shows the Bronx is the Big Apple's problem borough, with one in two bus trips there going unpaid for. Staten Island has also seen a spike in evasion, according to the New York Post.

Exact statistics have not yet been released by the MTA, with DailyMail.com reaching out for further details.

'The high rate is mostly being driven by [an approximately] 50 percent non-payment rate in the Bronx, and a jump in non-payment on Staten Island,' a source close to the MTA told the New York Post.

Worsening fare evasion has also been blamed on the five month period in 2020 when buses effectively became free across NYC. Riders were told to board buses by back doors only to try and limit contact with drivers during COVID, meaning they didn't have to buy a ticket or swipe their Metrocard.

The city's bus system saw a four per cent increase in fare evasion in three months from October to December, rising from 25.2 per cent in July, August, and September to 29.3 by the end of 2021, leaving the transit bureau with a $56million deficit. The bus system also lost $42million between July and September.

The Metropolitan Transportation Agency (MTA) has lost nearly $100million between October and December from ticketless riders. The bus system lost $65million in three months, while the subway system lost $41million

The MTA saw a four per cent increase in fare evasion throughout October, November, and December

The subway system - which has been plagued by murders, assaults and homeless people sleeping on trains in recent months - also lost $41million by riders who jumped the turnstiles.

But it is ridden by three times more people than the city's buses, with the costlier fare evasion on the latter showing just how severe the problem is.

'If you can get away with not paying your fare on the bus, chances are you'll also try it on subways,' Andrew Albert, an MTA board member, told the New York Post. 'We’re talking about massive fare loss on buses, which hurts the people who need it the most — the poor and those who cannot afford massive fare increases.'

The current fair for buses and subways is $2.75 a ride, with exceptions of the express buses - which cost $6.75 - and those eligible for reduced rates.

A weekly Metrocard, which can be used on all trains and buses, costs $33. From April 28, the new OMNY system, which lets riders use a payment card linked to their phone or a special swipe card, will stop charging bus and subway riders after they've taken 12 $2.75 rides in a week.

Fare evasion has been a hot topic since 2017, when MTA leaders raised alarms with little success. Despite the alarm bells, Manhattan and Brooklyn stopped prosecuting fare evaders in 2018, according to the New York Post.

However, the NYPD still can ticket for fare evasion and did so to around 14,500 subway riders in the fourth quarter of 2021. Almost 40,000 bus riders were handed tickets - most with a $100 fine - in 2021, an MTA representative told DailyMail.com on Tuesday.

MTA spokesperson Aaron Donovan told the New York Post that 'fare evasion is a crime against ordinary New Yorkers who pay their fair' and that enforcement teams are out daily to combat fare evasion.

'That’s why NYC Transit deploys enforcement teams to combat bus fare evasion on a daily basis. It’s easier to pay a $2.75 fare than a $100 fine,' Donovan told DailyMail.com on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, MTA Chair Janno Lieber credited the increase in fare evasion to the five-month period in 2020 where buses were free for all riders to limit the number of interactions between drivers and riders during the pandemic.

'The whole fare payment system has slightly broken down on buses, in my view,' Lieber said before the State Legislature on Tuesday.

More than 100 MTA workers lost their lives to COVID-19, according to the MTA, which recently released a memorial video of those lost as part of its Travel Far collection.

Nearly half of all Bronx riders (pictured) are evading fares. Staten Island is also experiencing an increase

New York City Mayor Eric Adams, 61, has recently announced a subway safety plan, which includes attacking fare evasion, getting the homeless off the subway systems at night, and upping public safety in the stations and trains.

Adams, a onetime transit police officer who took office last month and recently deemed the subway unsafe, said Friday that allowing people to live on subways is 'cruel and inhumane' to them and unfair to other riders and transit workers.

'No more just doing whatever you want,' Adams said at a news conference at a Lower Manhattan subway station. 'Those days are over. Swipe your MetroCard, ride the system, get off at your destination. That's what this administration is saying.'

'People tell me about their fear of using the system,' Adams said on Friday. 'And we're going to ensure that fear is not New York's reality.'

The plan, which is deemed as essential to New York City's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, also includes changes that are supposed to connect more homeless people, many of whom have mentally illness, substance abuse problems or both, to mental health services and permanent housing.

New York City's subway carried more than 5million riders on an average weekday before the coronavirus pandemic; the weekday average is now about three million.

According to the latest data from the New York City Police Department, since the beginning of the year, there have been 276 instances of crime in the subway system, which represent a 65 percent increase compared to the same period in 2021.

Adams's plan involves sending more police, mental health clinicians and social service outreach workers into the subways. Levy said Monday that a 'phased-in' implementation was beginning.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams, 61, recently announced a subway safety plan, which focuses on fare evasions, public safety, and getting the homeless off the trains. 'No more just doing whatever you want,' Adams said at a news conference at a Lower Manhattan subway station. 'Those days are over. Swipe your MetroCard, ride the system, get off at your destination. That's what this administration is saying'

The plan notes that more than 1,000 homeless people who use the subways for shelter need help, not handcuffs, but says police will have a zero-tolerance policy and will crackdown on sleeping, littering, smoking, doing drugs or hanging out in the system. It calls for clearing all passengers out of trains at the ends of their lines, an approach that has waxed and waned over the years.

The MTA, which runs the subways, 'knows that there are people in the subway system who need help and must and will be helped. But they can't stay in the subway system,' spokesperson Aaron Donovan said Monday.

Crime has also significantly risen on the transit systems, especially the subway, with transit crimes up 65 per cent this year.

Bloody Sunday: A stabbing victim's blood stains the wall and floor at the Canal Street station in Manhattan on Sunday night as the city sees a dramatic increase in transit crimes

Crime is up 46.5 per cent in the Big Apple, with transit crimes up 65 per cent

The weekend violence included a 31-year-old man who was stabbed while riding a southbound 6 train approaching Canal Street at 6.10pm on Sunday. Police say a stranger plunged a knife twice into his arm without any apparent provocation.

The attacker remained on the train as it continued on its way to Brooklyn, while the victim got off at the Canal Street station, where photographs showed his blood staining walls and floors.

The knifed man, who has not been named, was transported to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition.

The suspect, believed to be a man in his 30s, was described as wearing a colorful vest over a gray hoodie. He has not been arrested as of Tuesday morning.

Sunday's incident capped off a violent weekend, which saw at least five other people assaulted in the subway system in a span of 48 hours.

At around 3am on Saturday, a 46-year-old homeless man was stabbed multiple times in the thigh and buttocks during a robbery attempt at Jamaica station in queens

About 12 hours later, a man punched a 20-year-old woman on the 3 train platform at Livonia and Van Siclen Avenues in Brooklyn. An argument ensued, during which police say the male attacker pulled out a knife and stabbed the woman three times in the abdomen. The victim was hospitalized in stable condition.

At around 8.30pm on Saturday, a 24-year-old man was standing on the A-C-E platform in the 168th Street station in Manhattan when police say he was stabbed by two teens during a botched robbery attempt.

About 30 minutes later, another man was riding a southbound train in Morningside Heights in Manhattan when he was knifed after asking a stranger to stop smoking.

Last year, the rates of violent acts on the subway per million-weekday passengers were up in almost every crime category compared with 2019. Thirty people were pushed onto the tracks, which is ten people more compared to 20 in 2019 and nine in 2017, NYPD said. Felony assaults in the system went up nearly 25 percent, despite fewer passengers riding the subways due to the effects of the pandemic.

On the first day of Mayor Eric Adams subway safety plan homeless people continue to stay on the trains at the Flatbush Junction train station while the police and homeless outreach personal are absent

In recent weeks, a woman was pushed in front of a train and killed under Times Square, a man was shoved onto the tracks and injured at a major hub in lower Manhattan, and even the mayor said he didn't feel entirely safe riding the nation's busiest subway system.

Adams did not give any specific details and timelines on his plan's progress on Friday, and given the chronic shortage of housing options that are mostly priced at an affordable rate for people who choose to live in the subway, it was unclear where those who found a home underground would go if they are evicted, if won't be the streets. Details on the plan’s cost or how it would be paid remain scarce.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10538901/HALF-Bronx-bus-passengers-fare-dodging-1-3-bus-trips-taken-without-ticket.html
NYPD deployed to crackdown on fare evaders,2024-08-30 17:26:09+00:00,"(The Center Square) — New York City is deploying NYPD officers to help crack down on fare evaders on Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses, who are fleecing the city’s taxpayers out of more than $300 million a year.

The MTA announced this week that its EAGLE fare enforcement unit will begin patrolling undisclosed bus routes along with NYPD officers, who have been empowered to issue summons to fare scofflaws ranging from $50 to $100, and even make arrests.

Mayor Eric Adams said authorities plan to get tough on MTA fare invaders, who he claims are contributing to the city’s estimated $900 million in projected budget deficits in the next four years.

“What folks don’t realize is that when you have that large number of people not paying the fare, then it increases the fare for those who are,” Adams told a radio station earlier this week. “We are now putting in place an initiative where we are going to crack down on this.”

He said the crackdown will send a message “that you will pay your fare on the bus, you will pay your fare on the subway, because it is not fair to those New Yorkers who are doing it.”

Nearly 47% of bus riders evaded the fare during the first three months of 2024, according to the latest MTA estimates. The agency says free bus rides cost $300 million last year, which adds to the MTA’s worsening financial picture. MTA bus drivers are not allowed to enforce the fare due to concerns about their safety, the agency says.

A state commission that looked at the issue found the MTA lost $500 million to fare evaders in 2021 and another $690 million last year, a 38% increase. Fare evaders on buses accounted for $315 million, while $285 million was lost on the subway system, according to the panel.

The transit agency faces a potential $2.6 billion budget deficit in 2025 and is seeking more state funding to help reduce its projected shortfalls.

Fares and tolls account for a significant proportion of the MTA’s annual budget revenue, or roughly $7 billion a year. The agency says every dollar lost to evasion “impairs the MTA’s financial stability, threatens reliable transit for all New Yorkers, and increases the need for alternative revenue sources, including through larger fare and toll hikes.”

“Fare and toll evasion is a sensitive issue that raises difficult questions about social cohesion, inequality, and appropriate use of enforcement,” the MTA said in a recent statement. “But the situation in New York has reached a crisis level, and avoiding the topic is no longer a viable option.”

The Citizens Budget Commission, a fiscal watchdog group, has compared the financial losses in 2023 from fare evaders to the amount of funding “that would be raised through two rounds of fare hikes.” The group has called on state and local authorities to do more to crack down on evaders.

“Simply put, sufficient fare revenue is essential to operate and maintain the high-quality, reliable, and affordable transit systems New Yorkers and the region rely on,” the commission said in a recent report. “More effective fare compliance is important to ensure adequate revenues. The alternative — charging paying riders and drivers more — would be unfair.”",https://blackchronicle.com/news/nypd-deployed-to-crackdown-on-fare-evaders/
Fare beating hurts everyone and must be stopped: Panel has several ideas to make sure that all pay for their rides,2023-05-30 00:00:00,"For the past year, we have chaired a blue-ribbon panel on fare and toll evasion for the MTA. Our report, just published, charts a generational reset on how this all-important issue is addressed.

We and our fellow panelists are 16 diverse New York leaders from the education, social justice, criminal justice and business communities. Here are three big things we learned in our work.

First, the problem is bigger than you think. Last year, the MTA lost almost $700 million to evasion — a staggering sum. Evasion has jumped sharply since the pandemic. These dollar losses threaten the financial stability of the transit system. Just as important, the spike in evasion threatens the sense that we are all in this together as New Yorkers. If evasion keeps increasing, the fiscal and social damage will only get worse.

A fare beater goes over turnstiles.

Second, the problem is broader than you think. There are disturbing amounts of evasion across the entire MTA. While subway evasion is at record levels, buses actually are the biggest problem — with nearly four in ten bus riders not paying. The MTA is also losing a combined $90 million a year from riders not paying their fares on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North, and from drivers avoiding the tolls at MTA bridges and tunnels.

These numbers came alive for us as we toured the MTA system and saw all kinds of evasion with our own eyes. We were shocked to see how casually New Yorkers of all kinds evade their fares and tolls, as if it has become acceptable behavior.

Third, the solutions, too, need to be bigger and broader. Our panel aims to move beyond the traditional policing-focused responses, with a comprehensive approach that targets root causes through the Four Es: Education, Equity, Environment, and Enforcement.

Environment means depending more on design and technology, and less on policing. For the subways, this means the MTA should move beyond the traditional turnstiles and emergency gates to modern faregates with taller and wider plexiglass doors. These new gates would make it easier for everyone to pay, and harder for anyone to evade. They should also make it possible to move beyond the current emergency exit gates — currently the pathway for more than half of subway fare evasion. Technology can also address evasion on commuter rail, where riders often evade by not activating the e-tickets on their phones. At the bridges and tunnels, technology can help detect and stop the drivers who hide or forge their license plates.

Equity is central to our strategy. We are calling for a dramatic expansion of the city’s Fair Fares program, which provides 50% bus and subway discounts for low-income riders. We also urge that enforcement and equity can, and must, go hand in hand. The MTA, the police and communities working together to ensure that future evasion enforcement falls fairly on New Yorkers from all walks of life.

Education means a refreshed messaging campaign on the importance of paying fares and tolls, and the risks we face to our transit system and our civic culture if people don’t pay. Education also demands better supporting the city’s K-12 students: accelerating their switch to tap-and-go with OMNY, and fully funding their school-issued transit passes with an increase in their daily allotment of rides.

Enforcement plays a big part in our strategy, but with a clear call to move beyond the old approach of putting more and more cops at more and more faregates. Most evasion enforcement already takes the form of civil summonses. That approach should continue, with an expansion of the MTA’s Eagle Teams — a civilian force patrolling the buses.

The criminal justice system should focus on serious offenders: fare evaders who also commit major crimes, and “evasion enablers” who profit off scams, like the vandalism of MetroCard machines or the sale of license plate blockers, that drive others to evade. We are excited to announce that, in connection with our report, all five district attorneys have publicly committed to these priorities. We also encourage the DAs to consider prosecuting recidivist fare evaders.

In short, this is not yesterday’s evasion problem and yesterday’s solutions will not do. We believe our panel’s anti-evasion strategy meets the moment. A well-funded transit system is essential to our region and is an engine for equity. The MTA and all stakeholders must step up and turn the tide before the impacts of evasion become irreversible.

MTA Steps Up Emergency Exit Fare Evasion Prevention,2022-05-04 17:10:47-04:00,"Straphangers walk out of an emergency exit at the 28th Street station at Park Avenue on the Nos. 4 and 6 subway lines in Manhattan.

The MTA wants to re-examine its emergency exit gates in subway stations amid its renewed focus on curbing fare evasion, agency chief Janno Lieber said Wednesday.

“There’s no question that those emergency exit gates, which are an attempt to comply with the fire code — so God forbid people can get out in a fire emergency — that design has not worked, because it’s become a superhighway for fare evasion, honestly,” Lieber said during a May 4 appearance on the Brian Lehrer Show on WNYC.

“A lot of the riders who want to play by the rules are feeling like they’re suckers because they’re paying the fare and they see people sail right past them through the emergency gates,” he added.

The chair and CEO of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority added that his recently-convened commission on fare evasion will look at how to comply with fire codes without leaving an easy way for people to not pay $2.75.

“One of the principal things that this panel is going to look at is are there different designs for the fare gates — maybe it’ll be floor to ceiling … but especially this exiting requirement. How do we comply with the fire code without creating something that’s going to be an open door,” said Lieber.

The transit big last week assembled the 12-member “blue ribbon” panel to study fare evasion on the subways and buses, along with uncollected tickets on its two commuter railroads, and toll dodgers on the Authority’s seven bridges and two tunnels.

The MTA estimates that all those unpaid fares and tolls will cost the agency more than $500 million this year based on current rates, Lieber said.

His recent push comes after years of MTA leaders and politicians beating the drum about fare evasion, and former Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2019 also took aim at redesigning the fare gates.

In 2005 and 2006, the MTA expanded the quick exits by modifying some 1,500 locked access gates in its system to allow riders to get out easily during emergencies by pushing a so-called “panic bar.”

The move was reportedly lobbied for by pols after the 2005 bombings of the London Underground.

The gates let off a piercing alarm anytime someone opened them, until MTA turned off the screeching noise in 2014 — only to turn it back on as an NYPD-requested pilot project in 2019 at 10 stations to see if the racket would deter fare evasion.

“There are a lot of people who contend that as soon as the alarm came off the gates, fare evasion increased,” said Lisa Daglian, the executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA, an in-house rider advocacy group.

The issue of locked emergency gates resurfaced on social media recently, when a rider posted about a shut exit at the Vernon Boulevard-Jackson Avenue station in Long Island City, Queens, on April 16.

As part of the crackdown on fare evasion, more emergency exits in NYC subways are locked. This is wrong and dangerous for countless reasons. Also a person on my train couldn’t get their baby stroller out. I tried helping them lift it over the turnstiles but it wouldn’t fit. 🤬 pic.twitter.com/Zp0cXH0sFF — Jared Chausow – Go to bit.ly/ParoleJusticeAction (@jchausow) April 16, 2022

The viral post came just days after the mass shooting on a subway train in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, on April 12, when 10 straphangers were shot and riders ran for their lives out of blood-stained trains and platforms.

The tweet spawned several other reports of locked emergency gates from riders, such as 161st Street-Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, 86th Street station at Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, and Franklin Avenue and Utica Avenue stations in Brooklyn.

The New York City Transit Subway Twitter account responded to some saying the gates were “malfunctioning,” adding that the agency only locks the gates for long-term construction work.

Hello, Jenn. That gate was malfunctioning: We don't lock emergency gates unless there is long-term construction work. This problem was fixed by our team yesterday, and the gate is working again. ^TS — NYCT Subway (@NYCTSubway) April 18, 2022

An agency spokesperson said MTA does not lock the gates if the stations are open to the public.

“NYC Transit does not deliberately lock emergency gates to deter fare evasion or for any other reason in stations that are open to the public,” said Sean Butler in an email. “When vandalism or other issues necessitate maintenance and repairs, those are ordered expeditiously.”

The full-size gates also are also essential access for people using wheelchairs, parents with strollers, or commuters carrying large objects that are hard to get through the turnstiles, noted Daglian.

She also recently saw an emergency gate at the Vernon Boulevard-Jackson Avenue stop out of order, the same stop of the viral tweet two weeks ago.

“I saw people lifting their kids’ strollers over the turnstiles, trying to get out with heavy packages and bulky packages,” she said.

“It’s important that they work and be functional,” Daglian continued. “God forbid there’s a fire, you want to have as many egress points as possible and having a locked exit is akin to locking all the doors in a house and not being able to get out.”

"NYPD Recklessly Opens Fire On Man Evading $2.90 Subway Fare, Bullets Hit Three Others On Train",2024-09-17 14:35:13+00:00,"The New York Police Department is in hot water after an officer opened fire within a train car, injuring four people.

According to ABC 7, on Sunday (Sept. 15) two officers attempted to stop a 37-year-old man who had allegedly evaded paying a $2.90 train fare at a Brownsville, Brooklyn, station. Reportedly, officers tried to stop him, but he continued to the train platform anyway.

“The officers are asking him to stop. The male is refusing to stop at a certain point on the platform,” NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey stated. “The male, he mutters the words, ‘I’m going to kill you if you don’t stop following me.’”

According to Maddrey, the suspect Derell Mickles, allegedly brandished a knife and antagonized authorities to shoot him in order to stop him. The altercation reportedly moved from the platform into an L train car, where officers tasered him.

Police then reportedly opened fire inside the train car, piercing the man, and recklessly hitting another officer and two passengers: a 26-year-old woman and a 49-year-old man. Per the outlet, all four are in the hospital recovering, as the woman and Mickles are both in critical condition.

The NYPD has since released a statement, including the claim that the suspect’s alleged knife “went missing during the shooting,” but they identified who they believe took it.

NYC Mayor Eric Adams, took to X following the incident to say: “Earlier today, one of our officers was shot while protecting our subway system. I am relieved to report he is in good condition now, and we have arrested the suspect who put so many lives in danger. I cannot thank these officers enough for their bravery.”

His statement was clarified by a community note where users added: “The officer in question was shot by a fellow NYPD officer. NYPD officers also shot 2 bystanders and the fare evasion suspect.”

MTA concerned that drivers will evade congestion pricing toll,2024-02-29 00:00:00,"When the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rolls out its congestion pricing plan, there is the reality that they might not be able to toll everyone.

""Fare evasion in the subway is a theft of service and you can be arrested for that. Toll evasion is not,"" Catherine Sheridan, the president of MTA Bridges and Tunnels, said at the MTA's February board meeting Wednesday.

Police can make an arrest when a license plate is altered or associated with another crime. But the MTA does not have many tools to catch those who do not pay for tolls by obscuring their plates with devices.

""So we're asking for theft of services to be added to toll violations. Additionally, we're looking to be able to arrest for use of electronic or mechanical devices,"" Sheridan said. ""So right now, we can write a summons, but we can't even take the device.""

While police cannot monitor all 110 congestion pricing toll gantries in the city, the NYPD will try its best.

""These cars with fake plates, counterfeit plates and obscured plates are routinely used in crime,"" said Janno Lieber, the chair and CEO of the MTA. ""This is the way that criminals go about their business without encouraging the cops to catch them or allowing the cops to catch them.""

NYC unveils new 'jump-proof' MTA turnstiles as agency complains of fare evasion,2023-12-06 18:48:37+00:00,"With the MTA blaming 'fare evasion' for their budget woes, New York's transportation agency is trying out a new method to stop people from hopping over the turnstile.

The MTA's solution is a new turnstile with much higher doors - similar to the ones you see in the UK. It may not stop everyone, but the new doors are much higher and could prove to be a challenge to out-of-shape New Yorkers.

Today, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) announced ""the first-ever low turnstile fare array replacement with new wide-aisle fare gates at Sutphin Boulevard–Archer Avenue–JFK Airport E, J, Z, Station in Jamaica, Queens,"" said a press statement from the agency.

A report by the MTA’s Blue-Ribbon Panel on Fare Evasion found that the transit agency had lost $690 million in unpaid fares in 2022. Approximately 400,000 daily riders, or 10 to 15 percent, did not pay a fare.

The 8th Avenue-Penn Station A/C/E will be the second station to get the new setup, which is due to be installed next week, officials said. The cost to outfit the station was $700,000.

Cubic Corporation, the contractor behind the MTA’s massively delayed and buggy OMNY fare payment system, manufactured these new gates.

If this works, New Yorkers could soon see these installed in stations all over the city. The new fare gates were deployed at Jamaica's Sutphin Boulevard Archer Avenue-JFK Airport subway station.

The gated turnstiles replaced the emergency exit gate at the end of the station. According to the MTA, more than half of all fare evasion occurs through the emergency exit.

“New York City Transit’s North Star is improving the customer experience, and we are doing just that at Sutphin Blvd by introducing new, easier-to-access, fare gates and by opening our 14th Customer Service Center,” NYC Transit President Richard Davey said.

“Customers traveling to and from JFK with their luggage, commuters transferring from the LIRR at Jamaica, and local commuters can look forward to faster, more accessible journeys, and a more welcoming station environment.”

It does top Mayor Adams' plan to stop fare evasion - which was simply installing more officers at turnstiles, who have fined thousands of people so far.

""Economic need is one of the main drivers of fare evasion, so policing fare evasion is policing poverty, to a large extent,” said Harold Stolper, an economist at Columbia University. Many have complained about 'over-policing' in the subway stations.

Reports from 2022 show that Black and Latino New Yorkers accounted for 73 percent of people arrested, given a summons, or fined for fare evasion among all incidents where race and ethnicity were reported by the police, according to an analysis by Stolper.

Some people online have pointed out that New York stations already have evasion-proof turnstiles - and they've been there for decades.

However, Mayor Adams and the MTA have tried to ignore this issue, instead placing the blame elsewhere. ""Fare and toll evasion isn’t just an economics problem: it tears at the social contract that supports mass transit in New York City.""

""New Yorkers are sick of feeling like suckers seeing their neighbors beat the fare or cheat the toll while they pony up their fair share,"" Janno Lieber, MTA Chair and CEO said.

""The report findings address this emerging crisis with a comprehensive plan across all MTA services, while also acknowledging that enforcement alone will not solve this problem. The MTA will look to implement some of the Panel’s key recommendations, and we thank them for their tremendous work,"" said Lieber earlier this year.",https://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/nyc-unveils-new-jump-proof-226154
EXCLUSIVE: OMNY Debuts on Fair Fares After Delays,2024-05-01 00:00:00,"New Yorkers who participate in the city's half-priced transit program Fair Fares will finally be able to use OMNY, the MTA's tap-and-go payment system — starting with a 90-day pilot for 50 riders, city and MTA officials said.

Expanding the next generation payment system help will curb fare evasion and get the agency a step closer to allowing all-door boarding on its buses, officials told Streetsblog.

""We’re happy to embark on this 90-day pilot with these 50 participants to see what we can learn in an effort to roll this out more broadly so everyone can benefit from the simple tapping and riding that everyday customers are accustomed to right now,"" the MTA Chief Customer Officer Shanifah Rieara said in an exclusive interview with Streetsblog on Tuesday.

Fair Fares — run by the city's Department of Social Services — provides working-age New Yorkers who earn up to 120 percent of the federal poverty line 50 percent discounted MetroCards for subway, bus, and Access-A-Ride trips.

Officials had planned to integrate the program OMNY last year, but wanted to ensure there were enough vending machines for the new tap-payment cards in the system, they said.

Most OMNY uses pay with bank cards or smart devices linked to a bank accounts, but Fair Fares users largely don't have contactless cards. The MTA began deploying silver vending machines for OMNY cards last fall, and has since activated 39 kiosks at 25 stations, according to officials.

""Most of the participants are people who already participate in the cash assistance and SNAP programs, they have EBT cards. Those don’t have contactless capability,"" DSS First Deputy Commissioner Jill Berry said. ""Since we know that most people are refilling their Fair Fares MetroCards in the vending machines, one of the biggest pieces that we needed to sync up with the MTA on is rolling out OMNY as those vending machines are being launched into the system.""

The MTA and city hope to expand the pilot to all Fair Fares participants by the end of the year, New York City Transit President Richard Davey said.

Fare Fares joining OMNY will help close existing gaps in the service's coverage. About 800,000 New Yorkers are eligible for the program, though currently enrollment sits at just 331,000, according the latest figures on its website.

While riders used OMNY for 70 percent of regular fare subway trips, which make up 65 percent of total trips, usage is lower among bus riders. Key constituencies, such as kids commuting to school and riders who used pre-taxed fare cards, are also still excluded from the program. Only 45 percent of bus trips are full-fare trips; of those, riders paid for 56 percent with OMNY in 2023, according to MTA figures. Fair Fares trips make up just over five percent of bus riders, according to the MTA's previous analysis of OMNY trips.

Grade school students could get OMNY as soon as this fall too, said Davey, who hopes their inclusion will address the large number of pupils who don’t swipe into the system when they ride.

“Fare evasion is its highest right after school gets out around three o’clock,” Davey said. “One of our hypotheses is actually fares aren’t being evaded, students aren’t swiping.”

The MTA's Reduced Fare program, which provides half fares for people over 65-years-old or who have a disability, has been available on OMNY for smart devices since 2022, but is not yet available for OMNY cards. Reduced Fare MetroCard holders make up another 10.5 percent of total monthly bus trips.

Mayor Adams and the City Council last year increased the threshold from 100 percent of the federal poverty level to 120 percent, but advocates and politicians at the state and city level have called on the mayor to raise the bar to double the poverty line. Doing so would bring the program in line with other low income transit benefits around the country.

Riders who make minimum wage or slightly above are ineligible for Fair Fares, but still struggle to afford commuting costs, according to a recent report from the Community Service Society.

MTA already selected the 50 participants for the MTA's initial Fair Fares OMNY pilot. The group participated in an in-person orientation in March.

Can OMNY help rein in bus fare evasion?

Bus fare evasion eats into the MTA's budget, according to transit officials.

Paid ridership on the subway, the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North have all come in around the mid-point of the revenue and ridership projections that McKinsey and Co. conducted for the agency two years ago. But paid bus ridership is down almost 20 percent from the expected ridership, even as total bus ridership has rebounded to near pre-pandemic levels.

Paid bus ridership has detached itself from projections over the past 15 months. Graphic: MTA

The reduced amount of paid ridership on the bus means that bus revenue has come in $29 million under what the MTA expected for the first quarter of 2024, which the agency has mostly attributed to fare evasion. In contrast, the MTA says it's only down about $7 million from its expected revenue on the subway. The MTA included $100 million in its budget to deal with potential shortfalls in ridership, but the shortfall on the bus has eaten up over a quarter of that backstop by itself, according to officials.

MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber admitted in December that the agency ability to tackle bus fare evasion — which accounts to over one-third of trips — depended on the expansion of the tap-and-go system to enable effective fare enforcement on buses.

""The quicker we can get the OMNY system in place, I believe that we're going to have more ability to do European-style checking where you send somebody out on a bus and check everybody for proof of payment,"" Lieber said at a Dec. 13 event hosted by the Citizens Budget Commission. He echoed that point on Tuesday.

""One of the big milestones that we're pushing towards is the specialty fares,"" Lieber told reporters at a press conference following the agency's April board meeting. ""It's getting kids who ride buses disproportionately to school on to OMNY and off of the wacky system of many different types of MetroCards. It's getting reduced fare customers on to OMNY. It's getting the benefits providers to accept OMNY [and] stop sending people monthly MetroCards.""

""I believe that, when we get there, that the usage of OMNY on buses is going to significantly increase. Bus fare evasion is a real challenge that we are we are struggling with, it is a significant threat to the economics of of the MTA.""

Community Service Society CEO and MTA Board member David Jones — a critic of the agency's focus on fare evasion as a crime fighting tool on the subway — welcomed half-price subway fares finally coming to OMNY. Jones agreed with Lieber that fare enforcement on buses could be more effective and once all riders are able to use OMNY.

""It's a good idea, I fully support it,"" said David Jones, a city appointee to the MTA Board and the president and CEO of the Community Service Society.

""I think this notion of using armed or extraordinarily expensive police personnel to do this work is a waste. [Have] somebody able to check people's tickets, and looking at their OMNY readers, and then asking them to pay the fare. And if they don't, calling in assistance if necessary, or providing a summons. The bus driver can focus on driving and the individual with the reader can focus on fare collection.""",https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/01/exclusive-omny-debuts-on-fair-fares-after-delays
MTA spending $1M per month on private security guards in subway system,2022-12-12 00:00:00,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is shelling out $1 million per month on private security guards who are posted at subway station turnstiles to deter fare evasion, an agency honcho said Monday.

Richard Davey, president of the MTA’s subway and bus systems, divulged the price tag while testifying at a hearing held by the City Council’s Transportation and Public Safety committees. He defended the outsourcing, saying the authority has seen an uptick in fare revenue thanks to the security guard initiative.

“It’s a wise investment,” Davey said.

But some Council members questioned the wisdom of pouring that much taxpayer cash into the coffers of private security guard companies.

“This is a waste of taxpayers’ money,” Brooklyn Councilwoman Darlene Mealy told Davey.

A man jumps over the turnstile at a Harlem subway entrance in this file photo.

Mealy, a Democratic member of the Council’s Public Safety Committee, argued the money would be better spent on boosting the MTA’s workforce, whose members could perform the same job as the guards.

“Just hire more transit workers,” she said.

The private security guards, who are in uniform and started fanning out throughout the subway system this fall, do not have authority to arrest or fine fare-beaters. If they spot someone jumping a turnstile, the guards are supposed to alert NYPD officers so that they can conduct an arrest or issue a summons.

There are about 200 private security guards in the subway system as part of the fare evasion crackdown effort, according to MTA officials who testified alongside Davey at Monday’s hearing.

At a recent MTA board meeting, officials said the presence of security guards has resulted in a $100,000 monthly revenue uptick — not enough to offset the $1 million they cost every month.

Davey said the security guards aren’t only meant for balancing budget sheets, though. They also make the system feel safer, helping the NYPD as it scrambles to address a recent uptick in crime underground, Davey said.

The MTA is in dire straits financially and has projected it could lose as much as $500 million in revenue due to fare evasion this year alone. At the same time, the authority is staring down a budget deficit that could grow as large as $3 billion by 2025.

Davey said the private security program is thereby justified.

“We’re going to keep them for a while until we see some of the fare evasion stabilize,” Davey said of the guards.

NYPD officials at the Council hearing echoed Davey’s concerns.

“We just want people to pay,” acting NYPD Transit Chief Michael Kemper said, adding that he believes a “sense of lawlessness” would take over the subway system if fare evasion goes unchecked.

Just 3% of subway riders caught hopping turnstiles are arrested, almost exclusively for outstanding warrants on other crimes, according to Kemper. The remaining 97% are let go with tickets.

“This is not about arresting people,” he said. “This is about correcting a problem that’s quite evident.”",https://www.nydailynews.com/2022/12/12/mta-spending-1m-per-month-on-private-security-guards-in-subway-system/
These 5 MTA bus routes are fare free for NYC riders starting Sunday,2023-09-23 16:01:55.465000+00:00,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Who said there’s no such thing as a free ride?

Starting Sunday, riders of five New York City bus routes, including one on Staten Island, will ride free-of-charge for at least six months thanks to a new MTA pilot program that was included in the most recent state budget.

“The MTA carefully selected one route in every borough to study potential benefits and impacts on ridership, operations and other factors, and the buses are ready to roll,” said NYC Transit Senior Vice President of Buses Frank Annicaro.

On Staten Island, the MTA has selected the S46/96, which operates between South Avenue, West Shore Plaza Shopping Center and the St. George Ferry Terminal, serving roughly 60,000 riders per month, according to MTA data.

Starting Sunday, riders of the selected bus routes will not be required to pay fares upon boarding for anywhere from six months to a year.

“Today, as Staten Island’s S46/96 bus route takes a historic step forward with the fare-free pilot program, we are redefining the essence of community and connectivity,” said Assemblyman Charles D. Fall (D-North Shore). “This isn’t just about easing transportation costs; it’s a testament to our unwavering commitment to serving every Staten Islander, especially those in disadvantaged communities. This transportation initiative is a commitment to ensuring a brighter and more connected future for every Staten Islander.”

Other routes selected for the pilot program include the Bx18 A/B in the Bronx, the B60 in Brooklyn, the M116 in Manhattan and the Q4 LCL/LTD in Queens.

Access-A-Ride paratransit trips that begin or end within three-quarters of a mile of each of the fare-free bus route areas also will be provided free-of-charge.

Routes were chosen based on a variety of factors, including equity for low-income communities, ridership, fare-evasion rates and access to major employers and commercial centers.

“I commend Governor Hochul’s announcement of the fare-free bus pilot program on the S46/96 route in my district,” said Councilwoman Kamillah M. Hanks (D-North Shore). “This initiative will benefit the community and provide a significant advantage to the diverse population it serves, while improving mass transit options for the thousands of daily bus riders.”

All buses included in the pilot program will be clearly marked with “Fare Free” signage and will have their fare boxes and OMNY readers covered for the duration of the pilot.

The agency noted that the pilot program will not include free transfers to other buses or subway lines, meaning those with a multi-legged commute will still need to pay a fare.",https://www.silive.com/news/2023/09/these-5-mta-bus-routes-are-fare-free-for-nyc-riders-starting-sunday.html

MTA weighing replacements for NYC subway turnstiles in bid to combat growing fare evasion problem,2023-05-17 00:00:00,"Fare evasion could render obsolete the subway turnstiles first installed in New York City a century ago.

The MTA displayed different models of modern fare gates at Grand Central Terminal on Wednesday that could help fix the fare evasion problem, which a new report says cost the subway system $285 million in 2022.

The report — put together by a 16-person panel of notable New Yorkers and first reported by the Daily News — says that in all, the MTA lost $690 million last year to fare and toll evaders on its subways, buses, trains and bridges and tunnels.

A possible turnstile replacement manufactured by Conduent.

Investing in new subway gate technology could reduce the MTA’s losses.

“These fare gates are designed to make it much much harder for persons to evade paying the fare coming in,” Roger Maldonado, an attorney and co-chair of the agency’s fare evasion panel, said Wednesday.

The new fare gates would replace the rotating turnstiles with motorized, plexiglass panels or doors. Similar systems are used in transit systems worldwide, where their height discourages would-be fare jumpers.

MTA chair Janno Lieber tests a fare-gate manufactured by Conduent, which uses sensors to track people moving through the doors and alert authorities when more than one person enters per swipe.

Conduent, a U.S. firm, displayed a gate with two widths — one tailored to wheelchair accessibility. The glowing green gate included sensors that would ensure two riders didn’t slip through on one swipe, a company spokesman said.

Conduent sales director Bill Brunet took MTA chair Janno Lieber through the test gate on one swipe — causing the fare-evading transit boss to set off an alarm.

Conduent fare gates are used on French transit systems, and Philadelphia’s SEPTA plans a pilot test of the units next year.

A fare-gate by German company Scheidt-Bachmann on display Wednesday.

Scheidt-Bachmann, the firm that provides fare collection equipment for Boston’s MBTA system, also had a unit on hand.

French company Easier had two fare gates on display that featured plexiglass panels that rotated up and out of the way of a passengers entering the system.

Thales, which manufactures fare gates used in parts of Paris’ transit systems, had a video display at the showcase as well.

Maldonado said people could easily exist the subway system through the gates in an emergency — ending the need for the emergency doors his panel says are the main source of fare evasion.

Any plan to replace the turnstiles is still in the early stages, and no bidding or procurement process has been started, MTA chair Janno Lieber said.

“We’re going to put out a request for information to look at different models of gates, we’re starting to study the ones you see behind us,” he said.

“Obviously, that kind of a move at that scale is going to take a while,” Lieber said when asked how long it would take to outfit the city’s 472 stations with new gates.

NYC Is Using AI to Scan Subway Fare Dodgers for ‘Research Purposes’,2023-07-20 20:15:00+00:00,"New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority has admitted it uses cameras equipped with AI software to scan riders believed to have jumped subway turnstiles without paying fares. The MTA, which says it collects the scans “as a counting tool” plans to expand the system to more than two dozen more stations by the end of the year.

An MTA official speaking with Gizmodo said the tools are only intended for “research purposes” but civil liberties groups fear the previously unknown monitoring of transit riders could pose long-term privacy risks and unnecessarily shift resources and focus away from exploring ways to make mass transit more affordable and accessible. MTA Spokesperson Joana Flores took issues with the use of the words tracking and scanning to describe the system.

“The MTA uses this tool to quantify the amount of fare evasion without identifying fare evaders,” Flores said.

MTA revealed it deploys an AI system made by Spanish software company AWAAIT across seven stations in a May report first spotted by NBC News. The system tracks transit riders who allegedly use numerous methods to avoid paying ever more expensive fares. During the test period, for example, the system reportedly determined that 12% of fare dodgers ducked under turnstiles while 20% hopped over them. The majority of the cases (over 50%) involved passengers walking through open emergency exit gates. Presumably, that last data point means casual riders simply following others through an open door may wind up detected by this system.

Officials say they plan to expand the scanning software to around two dozen more stations by the end of the year with more to follow after that. A redacted MTA contract sent to NBC News by the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project shows the MTA experimenting with this system as early as July 2022. It’s unclear whether or not the feature can detect riders’ faces.

AWAAIT, the Barcelona-based AI company providing the software to the MTA offers a product called DETECTOR which it describes as a “real-time analytics system that helps to tackle fare evasion using a selective approach.” One camera installed above a ticket barrier can monitor multiple gates at one time with “robust” accuracy, the company claims. Once offending passengers are identified, ticket inspectors can then receive an alert on an app. The company claims its system is now operational in three major cities.

AWAAIT did not respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment seeking details on the accuracy of its systems or whether or not it can be used to detect faces. Instead, the company’s founder and CEO Xavier Arrufat sent an email saying the company respects its users’ privacy.

“We respect our customers’ privacy, so we only comment on information they have already publicly disclosed regarding their usage,” Arrufat said.

AWAAIT released a YouTube video showcasing DETECTOR operating in a Barcelona subway.

MTA says it won’t share data with police, but rights groups aren’t convinced

The MTA has justified the scanning as a way to try and address an estimated $690 million lost to fare evasion in 2022. In its report, MTA officials claimed it would be “cost prohibitive” to have human checkers perform hard checks of evasions at stations. The MTA did not respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment on why it needs face scans in particular to accurately measure fare dodgers.

An MTA official told NBC News it’s not currently sharing the data it gathers with New York police but would not comment on whether that practice would continue moving forward. An MTA official told Gizmodo it only stores the data collected from this system for a limited time, but could not provide more details when asked for a precise length of time.

Civil liberties groups expressed skepticism about the MTA’s supposed commitment to silo this type of sensitive data away from law enforcement.

“In a city where law enforcement has a history of evading oversight of its use of technology, it’s hard to believe that they don’t have plans to use this to expand policing,” Fight for The Future’s Caitlin Seeley George told Gizmodo. “And while they might claim it’s just to track fare evaders, it has the potential to expand surveillance of everyone traveling in the city.”

STOP Executive Director Albert Fox Cahn agreed, adding that this surveillance approach overlooks the underlying cause for rare evasion: poverty and continually rising fare costs.

“This AI will just become a pretext for policing stations even more aggressively,” Fox Cahn said in a statement. “But no matter how much surveillance we install, we can’t get people to pay for the train if they can’t afford it. And this raises real concerns about how the MTA is tracking New Yorkers and where that data is kept.”

New York has made it clear they intend to boost surveillance capabilities throughout public transit in the name of public safety. Late last year, Governor Kathy Hochul held a press conference in which she said she hoped to install surveillance cameras in every subway car. Hochul went a step further and even invoked Geoge Orwell to say the quiet part out loud.

“You think Big Brother’s watching you on the subways? You’re absolutely right,” Hochul said.

”If you’re concerned about this, the best answer is don’t commit any crimes on the subways—then you won’t have any problems,” the governor added.

MTA Trying to Close Doors on Bus Fare Beaters Using Rear Exit to Board Without Paying,2022-05-09 21:07:15+00:00,"The number of city bus riders is continuing to go up from the record lows during the pandemic, a good sign for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. What's not good news: The number of fare-beaters is also increasing.

An MTA survey showed that nearly 30 percent of riders avoid paying the fare, as many hop onto buses through the rear door.

""There's not one bus that everyone pays. There's always someone who either goes through the back door or passes by the bus driver without paying,"" said Bronx resident Kimberly Diaz.

The MTA issued a memo reminding drivers on regular bus routes to not to hit the toggle switch that puts the doors in Select Bus Service mode, or SBS. Doing so automatically opens all doors at each stop.

Instead, the transit agency wants them to only the front door. Passengers looking to get off through the back door can open it themselves.

“The policy is intended to continue to offer customers easy exits while deterring fare evasion by reducing the time that rear doors are open while no one is exiting on local bus routes,"" MTA Spokesperson Aaron Donovan said.

""If they see a whole bunch of people, to not open the back door because people who don’t pay can camouflage themselves and enter through the back door,"" Diaz said. ""It’s not a bad idea but people are going to try to do it anyways.""

The transit workers union says the directive won’t help.

""Bus operators unlock the rear door at bus stops, so that exiting passengers can push the tape, open the door and get off. This memo does not change that practice. When passengers exit, fare-beaters take advantage of the open rear door and board through it,"" a official at the TWU Local 100 said.

Transit advocates believe activating an OMNY fare box by the rear doors could make a difference.

""The MTA needs to be doing more to get riders on through every door, and if the MTA can’t step up and keep its promise for all-door boarding, then Gov. Hochul needs to step in and make sure we’re doing everything possible to speed buses & boost ridership,"" said Danny Pearlstein, of the Riders Alliance.

Many buses already have an OMNY payment system by the back door, but are not functioning yet.

Armed guards' fare-beater crackdown already saving MTA $100K a month at 2 stations,2022-11-30 16:18:43.028000+00:00,"NEW YORK (1010 WINS) -- Armed guards placed in the subway by the MTA to discourage fare evasion have already saved the agency tens of thousands of dollars at two Brooklyn stations in recent months, officials said Tuesday as fare-beaters are on track to cost the MTA a half-billion dollars this year alone.

The private security guards were first deployed at the Myrtle–Wyckoff Avenues station in Bushwick. They’ve since been expanded to the nearby Halsey Street station and are now netting the MTA about $100,000 a month in additional revenue by discouraging scofflaws, officials said at an MTA board meeting.

“We launched two types of guard pilots over the last six months,” MTA safety official Robert Diehl told board members.

Diehl said the pilots include “armed guards in front of MetroCard vending machines, which make it easier for our customers to pay the fare by reducing vandalism of the MVMs and reducing the machine repair downtime.”

Additionally, private unarmed guards have been added at a dozen select stations across the transit system. Their job is to make sure the exit gates stay closed, unless they’re being used appropriately by people who have items like strollers, luggage or wheelchairs.

“Once that gate is open, it’s like Black Friday at Macy’s,” Diehl said. “Holding that gate is imperative to stopping half the amount of fare evasion in our stations.”

None of the guards can make arrests, but officials said their mere presence has been deterring people who may otherwise hop turnstiles or sneak in through opened exit gates to avoid paying their fair share.

MTA Chief Safety and Security Officer Patrick Warren said the guards are there to “keep people honest” as the MTA is on track to lose nearly $500 million in 2022 alone from people riding the rails for free.

Diehl said the guards could also prevent serious crimes from happening.

“Once you stop those small offenses, it doesn’t go to the bigger offenses,” Diehl said. “I mean even to the point of at turnstiles, you know, stopping people for fare evasion, have yielded people with guns.”

It's not only the guards that are cracking down on fare evasion. The NYPD's fare-evasion arrests have been up 97% this year compared to 2021, according to the department.

NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- New York City bus drivers are being reminded not to open rear and center doors on their vehicles as part of an effort to curb fare beating, which the MTA says has become an epidemic.

The agency says about one third of riders skip out on paying their fare, which is costing millions.

It happens all day, every day. Wherever there are buses, there are riders who don't pay the fare. Ken Williams drives a bus in Queens.

Subway crime remains a concern after statistics show a surge in incidents. Eyewitness News reporter Candace McCowan has more.

""I think that everybody who needs to get where they need to go should have enough responsibility and enough respect for themselves to be able to pay for their fare,"" he said.

By their own numbers, the MTA is losing half a million dollars every day to fare evasion on buses.

Riders are supposed to enter through the front door, where the fare is paid. Instead, many wait until someone exits through the rear doors, then they pile on.

At times Monday on the B35, Eyewitness News reporter NJ Burkett saw more people entering through the rear of the bus than they did through the front.

The driver can activate the rear door using a switch, but the MTA issued the directive ordering drivers to avoid opening the rear door as means to prevent people from boarding that way.

""We don't want to get in the middle of trying to collect fares, because all that leads to is fights and assaults,"" TWU Local #100 Vice President J.P. Patafio said. ""And we don't want any assaults on bus operators.""

MTA rolls out fare-free pilot on five bus routes across NYC,2023-09-24 23:52:15-04:00,"On Sept. 24, the MTA launched its newest pilot program that will make five bus routes— one in each borough— free for passengers for at least the next six months. The pilot will service around 43,900 daily riders and the five bus routes included are the Bx18A/B in the Bronx, the B60 in Brooklyn, the M116 in Manhattan, the Q4 in Queens, and the S46/96 in Staten Island.

The pilot is part of the state’s ""Fix the MTA"" legislative package— part of the 2024 fiscal year budget— and is intended to help the agency study how fare-free service affects ridership, access, equity, and fare evasion. State legislators say they hope to eventually make all buses and subway lines free.

During the program period, riders will be able board a fare-free bus without paying, however, if you're transferring to another bus or the subway, the fare must be paid at the transfer point. Buses that are part of the fare-free pilot can be identified by signs at bus stops along participating routes, buses marked ""Fare Free"" with green and black destination signage, decals on the bus, and bus fare boxes covered with signage.

“The MTA is the lifeblood of New York City, and I'm proud of the tremendous progress we've made in returning ridership to pre-pandemic levels,” said New York State Governor Kathy, who announced the program over the summer. “By establishing these fare free bus pilot routes, we are expanding access to public transportation across the city and improving transit equity to better serve all New Yorkers.”",https://nyc.urbanize.city/post/mta-rolls-out-fare-free-pilot-five-bus-routes-across-nyc
"Amid Violent Subway Crime Fears, MTA's Focus Jumps To Fare Evasion",2022-04-27 16:23:25+00:00,"Traffic & Transit Amid Violent Subway Crime Fears, MTA's Focus Jumps To Fare Evasion Turnstile jumping erodes the sense of fairness in MTA's system, ""and maybe in our society at large,"" said MTA honcho Janno Lieber.

NEW YORK CITY — Fare evasion in New York City's subways isn't just a minor annoyance — it's a sign of societal breakdown.

Or at least that was the message conveyed by MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber during the transit agency's board meeting Wednesday. Disorder of all kinds in the city's transit system, beyond a recent spate of violent crimes, is ripping apart the social fabric between New Yorkers, he said.

""One of the things that's eroding the sense of order and fairness in our system, and maybe in our society at large, is seeing other people enter through the emergency gates or walk by the bus operator without paying the fare, or obscure their license plate, or get a fake out-of-state license plate so they don't have to pay tolls,"" he said. Lieber's depiction of turnstile jumping as akin to an apocalyptic threat came as he announced a new ""blue ribbon panel"" devoted to tackling fare evasion.

It also came two weeks after a mass shooting in a Sunset Park subway station that left 23 people injured and stoked growing fears about violent crime in the subway system. Mayor Eric Adams has pledged to increase the NYPD's presence in subways and platforms — and Lieber said MTA officials have seen those patrols go up 34 percent.

But Lieber, in his discussion, shifted focus toward fare evasion — a long-standing annoyance for MTA board members. He admitted it seemed ""airy-fairy"" compared to concerns over safety, but claimed tackling the problem is about repairing the social fabric. ""The system only works when everybody contributes,"" he said. ""Honest and hardworking New Yorkers, many of them on fixed incomes are telling us that they are outraged and demoralized when they see people who are better, as I say, carrying $7 lattes — and we have this on video — waltzing through the emergency exit gates.

“It makes customers feel like suckers and it makes them wonder, ‘Why should I pay the fare,’” he said. Critics argue that fare evasion crackdowns unfairly target people of color or criminalize poverty. And Lieber tried to assuage those fears. He said the panel will look at better turnstile design and ""porous"" emergency exits. Fare evasion should not be a crime of poverty, so affordability and social justice will both be parts of the panel's focus, he said. ""This is not a fare evasion crackdown,"" he said. ""This is trying to develop a new strategy for how do we arrest what is growing and, I think is, at the verge of becoming an epidemic.""",https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/amid-violent-subway-crime-fears-mtas-focus-jumps-fare-evasion
"NYPD Recklessly Opens Fire On Man Evading $2.90 Subway Fare, Bullets Hit Three Others On Train",2024-09-17 14:35:13+00:00,"The New York Police Department is in hot water after an officer opened fire within a train car, injuring four people.

According to ABC 7, on Sunday (Sept. 15) two officers attempted to stop a 37-year-old man who had allegedly evaded paying a $2.90 train fare at a Brownsville, Brooklyn, station. Reportedly, officers tried to stop him, but he continued to the train platform anyway.

“The officers are asking him to stop. The male is refusing to stop at a certain point on the platform,” NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey stated. “The male, he mutters the words, ‘I’m going to kill you if you don’t stop following me.’”

According to Maddrey, the suspect Derell Mickles, allegedly brandished a knife and antagonized authorities to shoot him in order to stop him. The altercation reportedly moved from the platform into an L train car, where officers tasered him.

Police then reportedly opened fire inside the train car, piercing the man, and recklessly hitting another officer and two passengers: a 26-year-old woman and a 49-year-old man. Per the outlet, all four are in the hospital recovering, as the woman and Mickles are both in critical condition.

The NYPD has since released a statement, including the claim that the suspect’s alleged knife “went missing during the shooting,” but they identified who they believe took it.

NYC Mayor Eric Adams, took to X following the incident to say: “Earlier today, one of our officers was shot while protecting our subway system. I am relieved to report he is in good condition now, and we have arrested the suspect who put so many lives in danger. I cannot thank these officers enough for their bravery.”

His statement was clarified by a community note where users added: “The officer in question was shot by a fellow NYPD officer. NYPD officers also shot 2 bystanders and the fare evasion suspect.”

"MTA to spend $50M on 5 free bus routes across NYC, boosted subway service",2023-07-17 00:00:00,"Come on and take a free ride!

Five Big Apple bus routes will be free starting in late September, in part to monitor ridership numbers on transit lines with high fare evasion.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s troubleshooting plan is part of a $50 million state pilot pushed hard by progressives in Albany.

The funding also boosts the number of trains running on the No. 1, No. 6, C, N and R trains by 20 percent during the middays and on weekends.

“The MTA is the lifeblood of New York City, and I’m proud of the tremendous progress we’ve made in returning ridership to pre-pandemic levels,” said Gov. Kathy Hochul.

“By establishing these fare free bus pilot routes, we are expanding access to public transportation across the city and improving transit equity to better serve all New Yorkers.”

The free bus service, which is expected to serve 43,900 daily weekday riders, will last for at least six months with a price tag of $15 million, while the bolstered subway service will cost approximately $35 million.

Each borough gets one free route:

Bronx: The BX18 A/B, which runs from a loop from High Bridge to Morris Heights;

Brooklyn: The B60, which runs from Canarsie all the way to Williamsburg;

Manhattan: The crosstown M116 that links Central and East Harlem;

Queens: The Q4 that runs along Linden Blvd, Merrick Blvd and Archer Ave;

Staten Island: And the S46 that runs between the St. George Ferry Terminal and the West Shore Plaza Shopping Center and its limited stop twin, S96.

The transit lines were selected based on several factors: overall ridership, fare evasion, fairness for lower socio-economic communities, and commercial activity. The pilot will not include free transfers to buses or subway lines.

Crowding issues are expected as more people learn about the fare-free routes added MTA officials.

3 The MTA also announced bolstered service for several train lines by 20 percent during the middays and on weekends. J.C. Rice for NY Post

Officials at the subway system also said that promised expansion of service in May would continue to arrive in August.

The C train will see midday service boosted to every 8-10 minutes, cutting waits from the current 10-12 minutes, starting on August 7.

The No. 1 and No. 6 trains will see their weekend service increased to every 6 minutes starting August 12.

And the N and the R will see their midday service improved to trains arriving roughly every 8 minutes, up from every 10 minutes under the current schedule.

The MTA lost an estimated $690 million last year to toll and fare evaders. The transit agency estimated the fare evasion on buses alone dented the MTA’s budget by $315 million – almost more than subway, commuter railroad and toll evaders combined.",https://nypost.com/2023/07/17/mta-to-spend-50m-on-5-free-bus-routes-across-nyc-boosted-subway-service/
MTA concerned that drivers will evade congestion pricing toll,2024-02-29 00:00:00,"When the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rolls out its congestion pricing plan, there is the reality that they might not be able to toll everyone.

""Fare evasion in the subway is a theft of service and you can be arrested for that. Toll evasion is not,"" Catherine Sheridan, the president of MTA Bridges and Tunnels, said at the MTA's February board meeting Wednesday.

What You Need To Know The infrastructure for congestion pricing is nearly complete, as the 104th tolling gantry was installed Wednesday However, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is concerned about fare evasion when congestion pricing is finally launched The MTA does not have many tools to catch those who don’t pay for tolls by obscuring their license plates with devices The state has asked Amazon to not sell devices that obscure plates, but they can be found elsewhere on the internet

Police can make an arrest when a license plate is altered or associated with another crime. But the MTA does not have many tools to catch those who do not pay for tolls by obscuring their plates with devices.

""So we're asking for theft of services to be added to toll violations. Additionally, we're looking to be able to arrest for use of electronic or mechanical devices,"" Sheridan said. ""So right now, we can write a summons, but we can't even take the device.""

While police cannot monitor all 110 congestion pricing toll gantries in the city, the NYPD will try its best.

""These cars with fake plates, counterfeit plates and obscured plates are routinely used in crime,"" said Janno Lieber, the chair and CEO of the MTA. ""This is the way that criminals go about their business without encouraging the cops to catch them or allowing the cops to catch them.""

NYC unveils new 'jump-proof' MTA turnstiles as agency complains of fare evasion,2023-12-06 18:48:37+00:00,"With the MTA blaming 'fare evasion' for their budget woes, New York's transportation agency is trying out a new method to stop people from hopping over the turnstile.

The MTA's solution is a new turnstile with much higher doors - similar to the ones you see in the UK. It may not stop everyone, but the new doors are much higher and could prove to be a challenge to out-of-shape New Yorkers.

Today, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) announced ""the first-ever low turnstile fare array replacement with new wide-aisle fare gates at Sutphin Boulevard–Archer Avenue–JFK Airport E, J, Z, Station in Jamaica, Queens,"" said a press statement from the agency.

A report by the MTA’s Blue-Ribbon Panel on Fare Evasion found that the transit agency had lost $690 million in unpaid fares in 2022. Approximately 400,000 daily riders, or 10 to 15 percent, did not pay a fare.

The 8th Avenue-Penn Station A/C/E will be the second station to get the new setup, which is due to be installed next week, officials said. The cost to outfit the station was $700,000.

Cubic Corporation, the contractor behind the MTA’s massively delayed and buggy OMNY fare payment system, manufactured these new gates.

If this works, New Yorkers could soon see these installed in stations all over the city. The new fare gates were deployed at Jamaica's Sutphin Boulevard Archer Avenue-JFK Airport subway station.

The gated turnstiles replaced the emergency exit gate at the end of the station. According to the MTA, more than half of all fare evasion occurs through the emergency exit.

“New York City Transit’s North Star is improving the customer experience, and we are doing just that at Sutphin Blvd by introducing new, easier-to-access, fare gates and by opening our 14th Customer Service Center,” NYC Transit President Richard Davey said.

“Customers traveling to and from JFK with their luggage, commuters transferring from the LIRR at Jamaica, and local commuters can look forward to faster, more accessible journeys, and a more welcoming station environment.”

It does top Mayor Adams' plan to stop fare evasion - which was simply installing more officers at turnstiles, who have fined thousands of people so far.

""Economic need is one of the main drivers of fare evasion, so policing fare evasion is policing poverty, to a large extent,” said Harold Stolper, an economist at Columbia University. Many have complained about 'over-policing' in the subway stations.

Reports from 2022 show that Black and Latino New Yorkers accounted for 73 percent of people arrested, given a summons, or fined for fare evasion among all incidents where race and ethnicity were reported by the police, according to an analysis by Stolper.

Some people online have pointed out that New York stations already have evasion-proof turnstiles - and they've been there for decades.

However, Mayor Adams and the MTA have tried to ignore this issue, instead placing the blame elsewhere. ""Fare and toll evasion isn’t just an economics problem: it tears at the social contract that supports mass transit in New York City.""

""New Yorkers are sick of feeling like suckers seeing their neighbors beat the fare or cheat the toll while they pony up their fair share,"" Janno Lieber, MTA Chair and CEO said.

""The report findings address this emerging crisis with a comprehensive plan across all MTA services, while also acknowledging that enforcement alone will not solve this problem. The MTA will look to implement some of the Panel’s key recommendations, and we thank them for their tremendous work,"" said Lieber earlier this year.",https://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/nyc-unveils-new-jump-proof-226154
EXCLUSIVE: OMNY Debuts on Fair Fares After Delays,2024-05-01 00:00:00,"New Yorkers who participate in the city's half-priced transit program Fair Fares will finally be able to use OMNY, the MTA's tap-and-go payment system — starting with a 90-day pilot for 50 riders, city and MTA officials said.

Expanding the next generation payment system help will curb fare evasion and get the agency a step closer to allowing all-door boarding on its buses, officials told Streetsblog.

""We’re happy to embark on this 90-day pilot with these 50 participants to see what we can learn in an effort to roll this out more broadly so everyone can benefit from the simple tapping and riding that everyday customers are accustomed to right now,"" the MTA Chief Customer Officer Shanifah Rieara said in an exclusive interview with Streetsblog on Tuesday.

Fair Fares — run by the city's Department of Social Services — provides working-age New Yorkers who earn up to 120 percent of the federal poverty line 50 percent discounted MetroCards for subway, bus, and Access-A-Ride trips.

Officials had planned to integrate the program OMNY last year, but wanted to ensure there were enough vending machines for the new tap-payment cards in the system, they said.

Most OMNY uses pay with bank cards or smart devices linked to a bank accounts, but Fair Fares users largely don't have contactless cards. The MTA began deploying silver vending machines for OMNY cards last fall, and has since activated 39 kiosks at 25 stations, according to officials.

""Most of the participants are people who already participate in the cash assistance and SNAP programs, they have EBT cards. Those don’t have contactless capability,"" DSS First Deputy Commissioner Jill Berry said. ""Since we know that most people are refilling their Fair Fares MetroCards in the vending machines, one of the biggest pieces that we needed to sync up with the MTA on is rolling out OMNY as those vending machines are being launched into the system.""

The MTA and city hope to expand the pilot to all Fair Fares participants by the end of the year, New York City Transit President Richard Davey said.

Fare Fares joining OMNY will help close existing gaps in the service's coverage. About 800,000 New Yorkers are eligible for the program, though currently enrollment sits at just 331,000, according the latest figures on its website.

While riders used OMNY for 70 percent of regular fare subway trips, which make up 65 percent of total trips, usage is lower among bus riders. Key constituencies, such as kids commuting to school and riders who used pre-taxed fare cards, are also still excluded from the program. Only 45 percent of bus trips are full-fare trips; of those, riders paid for 56 percent with OMNY in 2023, according to MTA figures. Fair Fares trips make up just over five percent of bus riders, according to the MTA's previous analysis of OMNY trips.

Grade school students could get OMNY as soon as this fall too, said Davey, who hopes their inclusion will address the large number of pupils who don’t swipe into the system when they ride.

“Fare evasion is its highest right after school gets out around three o’clock,” Davey said. “One of our hypotheses is actually fares aren’t being evaded, students aren’t swiping.”

The MTA's Reduced Fare program, which provides half fares for people over 65-years-old or who have a disability, has been available on OMNY for smart devices since 2022, but is not yet available for OMNY cards. Reduced Fare MetroCard holders make up another 10.5 percent of total monthly bus trips.

Mayor Adams and the City Council last year increased the threshold from 100 percent of the federal poverty level to 120 percent, but advocates and politicians at the state and city level have called on the mayor to raise the bar to double the poverty line. Doing so would bring the program in line with other low income transit benefits around the country.

Riders who make minimum wage or slightly above are ineligible for Fair Fares, but still struggle to afford commuting costs, according to a recent report from the Community Service Society.

MTA already selected the 50 participants for the MTA's initial Fair Fares OMNY pilot. The group participated in an in-person orientation in March.

Can OMNY help rein in bus fare evasion?

Bus fare evasion eats into the MTA's budget, according to transit officials.

Paid ridership on the subway, the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North have all come in around the mid-point of the revenue and ridership projections that McKinsey and Co. conducted for the agency two years ago. But paid bus ridership is down almost 20 percent from the expected ridership, even as total bus ridership has rebounded to near pre-pandemic levels.

Paid bus ridership has detached itself from projections over the past 15 months. Graphic: MTA

The reduced amount of paid ridership on the bus means that bus revenue has come in $29 million under what the MTA expected for the first quarter of 2024, which the agency has mostly attributed to fare evasion. In contrast, the MTA says it's only down about $7 million from its expected revenue on the subway. The MTA included $100 million in its budget to deal with potential shortfalls in ridership, but the shortfall on the bus has eaten up over a quarter of that backstop by itself, according to officials.

MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber admitted in December that the agency ability to tackle bus fare evasion — which accounts to over one-third of trips — depended on the expansion of the tap-and-go system to enable effective fare enforcement on buses.

""The quicker we can get the OMNY system in place, I believe that we're going to have more ability to do European-style checking where you send somebody out on a bus and check everybody for proof of payment,"" Lieber said at a Dec. 13 event hosted by the Citizens Budget Commission. He echoed that point on Tuesday.

""One of the big milestones that we're pushing towards is the specialty fares,"" Lieber told reporters at a press conference following the agency's April board meeting. ""It's getting kids who ride buses disproportionately to school on to OMNY and off of the wacky system of many different types of MetroCards. It's getting reduced fare customers on to OMNY. It's getting the benefits providers to accept OMNY [and] stop sending people monthly MetroCards.""

""I believe that, when we get there, that the usage of OMNY on buses is going to significantly increase. Bus fare evasion is a real challenge that we are we are struggling with, it is a significant threat to the economics of of the MTA.""

Community Service Society CEO and MTA Board member David Jones — a critic of the agency's focus on fare evasion as a crime fighting tool on the subway — welcomed half-price subway fares finally coming to OMNY. Jones agreed with Lieber that fare enforcement on buses could be more effective and once all riders are able to use OMNY.

""It's a good idea, I fully support it,"" said David Jones, a city appointee to the MTA Board and the president and CEO of the Community Service Society.

""I think this notion of using armed or extraordinarily expensive police personnel to do this work is a waste. [Have] somebody able to check people's tickets, and looking at their OMNY readers, and then asking them to pay the fare. And if they don't, calling in assistance if necessary, or providing a summons. The bus driver can focus on driving and the individual with the reader can focus on fare collection.""",https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/01/exclusive-omny-debuts-on-fair-fares-after-delays
MTA spending $1M per month on private security guards in subway system,2022-12-12 00:00:00,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is shelling out $1 million per month on private security guards who are posted at subway station turnstiles to deter fare evasion, an agency honcho said Monday.

Richard Davey, president of the MTA’s subway and bus systems, divulged the price tag while testifying at a hearing held by the City Council’s Transportation and Public Safety committees. He defended the outsourcing, saying the authority has seen an uptick in fare revenue thanks to the security guard initiative.

“It’s a wise investment,” Davey said.

But some Council members questioned the wisdom of pouring that much taxpayer cash into the coffers of private security guard companies.

“This is a waste of taxpayers’ money,” Brooklyn Councilwoman Darlene Mealy told Davey.

A man jumps over the turnstile at a Harlem subway entrance in this file photo.

Mealy, a Democratic member of the Council’s Public Safety Committee, argued the money would be better spent on boosting the MTA’s workforce, whose members could perform the same job as the guards.

“Just hire more transit workers,” she said.

The private security guards, who are in uniform and started fanning out throughout the subway system this fall, do not have authority to arrest or fine fare-beaters. If they spot someone jumping a turnstile, the guards are supposed to alert NYPD officers so that they can conduct an arrest or issue a summons.

There are about 200 private security guards in the subway system as part of the fare evasion crackdown effort, according to MTA officials who testified alongside Davey at Monday’s hearing.

At a recent MTA board meeting, officials said the presence of security guards has resulted in a $100,000 monthly revenue uptick — not enough to offset the $1 million they cost every month.

Davey said the security guards aren’t only meant for balancing budget sheets, though. They also make the system feel safer, helping the NYPD as it scrambles to address a recent uptick in crime underground, Davey said.

The MTA is in dire straits financially and has projected it could lose as much as $500 million in revenue due to fare evasion this year alone. At the same time, the authority is staring down a budget deficit that could grow as large as $3 billion by 2025.

Davey said the private security program is thereby justified.

“We’re going to keep them for a while until we see some of the fare evasion stabilize,” Davey said of the guards.

NYPD officials at the Council hearing echoed Davey’s concerns.

“We just want people to pay,” acting NYPD Transit Chief Michael Kemper said, adding that he believes a “sense of lawlessness” would take over the subway system if fare evasion goes unchecked.

Just 3% of subway riders caught hopping turnstiles are arrested, almost exclusively for outstanding warrants on other crimes, according to Kemper. The remaining 97% are let go with tickets.

MTA tweaking turnstiles to crack down on straphangers who slip through — and cost agency $45M annually,2023-07-17 00:00:00,"The MTA is in the midst of fixing turnstiles to prevent would-be fare jumpers from easily slipping past the gates — costing the transit agency more than $45 million a year.

The fare evasion technique, known as “back cocking,” happens when the arm is pulled back on a turnstile and the person slips through the gate

“We’ve all seen it — someone pulls back on the bar just far enough to step over it when reversing to go in a forward direction,” Demetrius Crichlow, the MTA official in charge of the daily operations of the subway system said at a board meeting on Monday.

Additionally, transit officials said they are also considering installing plastic sleeves on the turnstile bars and metal fins on the sides of the fare gate stalls to make it harder for riders to lumber over.

To date, only 26 turnstiles have been modified but the MTA is aiming to complete 240 by September. In order to update the remaining 3,500 turnstiles across the rest of the system, it will cost roughly $2 million and take two years.

“If we can even get a portion of that back, it’ll save the company a lot of money,” Crichlow said.

Plans for a wider rethink of fare gates on the subway system are also underway, with additional details set to be released later this year.

The MTA demonstrated several models of fare gates that it is eyeing to potentially replace its decades-old setup that are harder to jump over and which have been used by transit systems across the country and in major cities internationally to cut down on fare beating.

The new high-tech systems also typically have the ability to open the gates automatically in the midst of an emergency, which MTA officials hope will allow the new designs to permanently do away with the emergency doors they’ve described as the “super highways” of fare evasion.

Philadelphia’s transit system just ordered one of the models the MTA is examining for two stations on its elevated rail line as it seeks to cut down on fare evasion, too.",https://nypost.com/2023/07/17/mta-tweaks-turnstiles-to-crack-down-on-straphangers-slipping-through/
These 5 MTA bus routes are fare free for NYC riders starting Sunday,2023-09-23 16:01:55.465000+00:00,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Who said there’s no such thing as a free ride?

Starting Sunday, riders of five New York City bus routes, including one on Staten Island, will ride free-of-charge for at least six months thanks to a new MTA pilot program that was included in the most recent state budget.

“The MTA carefully selected one route in every borough to study potential benefits and impacts on ridership, operations and other factors, and the buses are ready to roll,” said NYC Transit Senior Vice President of Buses Frank Annicaro.

On Staten Island, the MTA has selected the S46/96, which operates between South Avenue, West Shore Plaza Shopping Center and the St. George Ferry Terminal, serving roughly 60,000 riders per month, according to MTA data.

Starting Sunday, riders of the selected bus routes will not be required to pay fares upon boarding for anywhere from six months to a year.

“Today, as Staten Island’s S46/96 bus route takes a historic step forward with the fare-free pilot program, we are redefining the essence of community and connectivity,” said Assemblyman Charles D. Fall (D-North Shore). “This isn’t just about easing transportation costs; it’s a testament to our unwavering commitment to serving every Staten Islander, especially those in disadvantaged communities. This transportation initiative is a commitment to ensuring a brighter and more connected future for every Staten Islander.”

Other routes selected for the pilot program include the Bx18 A/B in the Bronx, the B60 in Brooklyn, the M116 in Manhattan and the Q4 LCL/LTD in Queens.

Access-A-Ride paratransit trips that begin or end within three-quarters of a mile of each of the fare-free bus route areas also will be provided free-of-charge.

Routes were chosen based on a variety of factors, including equity for low-income communities, ridership, fare-evasion rates and access to major employers and commercial centers.

“I commend Governor Hochul’s announcement of the fare-free bus pilot program on the S46/96 route in my district,” said Councilwoman Kamillah M. Hanks (D-North Shore). “This initiative will benefit the community and provide a significant advantage to the diverse population it serves, while improving mass transit options for the thousands of daily bus riders.”

All buses included in the pilot program will be clearly marked with “Fare Free” signage and will have their fare boxes and OMNY readers covered for the duration of the pilot.

The agency noted that the pilot program will not include free transfers to other buses or subway lines, meaning those with a multi-legged commute will still need to pay a fare.",https://www.silive.com/news/2023/09/these-5-mta-bus-routes-are-fare-free-for-nyc-riders-starting-sunday.html

Kathy Hochul to increase the penalty for cheating tolls by reclassifying the offense a “theft of service,” the same legal category as fare evasion on buses and subways.

Under New York state law, “theft of service” is a class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in prison.",https://www.silive.com/news/2024/02/ny-gov-hochul-urged-to-increase-penalty-for-toll-evasion-at-mta-bridges-and-tunnels.html
MTA weighing replacements for NYC subway turnstiles in bid to combat growing fare evasion problem,2023-05-17 00:00:00,"Fare evasion could render obsolete the subway turnstiles first installed in New York City a century ago.

The MTA displayed different models of modern fare gates at Grand Central Terminal on Wednesday that could help fix the fare evasion problem, which a new report says cost the subway system $285 million in 2022.

The report — put together by a 16-person panel of notable New Yorkers and first reported by the Daily News — says that in all, the MTA lost $690 million last year to fare and toll evaders on its subways, buses, trains and bridges and tunnels.

A possible turnstile replacement manufactured by Conduent.

Investing in new subway gate technology could reduce the MTA’s losses.

“These fare gates are designed to make it much much harder for persons to evade paying the fare coming in,” Roger Maldonado, an attorney and co-chair of the agency’s fare evasion panel, said Wednesday.

The new fare gates would replace the rotating turnstiles with motorized, plexiglass panels or doors. Similar systems are used in transit systems worldwide, where their height discourages would-be fare jumpers.

MTA chair Janno Lieber tests a fare-gate manufactured by Conduent, which uses sensors to track people moving through the doors and alert authorities when more than one person enters per swipe.

Conduent, a U.S. firm, displayed a gate with two widths — one tailored to wheelchair accessibility. The glowing green gate included sensors that would ensure two riders didn’t slip through on one swipe, a company spokesman said.

Conduent sales director Bill Brunet took MTA chair Janno Lieber through the test gate on one swipe — causing the fare-evading transit boss to set off an alarm.

Conduent fare gates are used on French transit systems, and Philadelphia’s SEPTA plans a pilot test of the units next year.

A fare-gate by German company Scheidt-Bachmann on display Wednesday.

Scheidt-Bachmann, the firm that provides fare collection equipment for Boston’s MBTA system, also had a unit on hand.

French company Easier had two fare gates on display that featured plexiglass panels that rotated up and out of the way of a passengers entering the system.

Thales, which manufactures fare gates used in parts of Paris’ transit systems, had a video display at the showcase as well.

Maldonado said people could easily exist the subway system through the gates in an emergency — ending the need for the emergency doors his panel says are the main source of fare evasion.

Any plan to replace the turnstiles is still in the early stages, and no bidding or procurement process has been started, MTA chair Janno Lieber said.

“We’re going to put out a request for information to look at different models of gates, we’re starting to study the ones you see behind us,” he said.

“Obviously, that kind of a move at that scale is going to take a while,” Lieber said when asked how long it would take to outfit the city’s 472 stations with new gates.

Automatic turnstiles that accepted coins were introduced to the subway system in the 1920s. The new technology allowed the MTA’s predecessors to lay off hundreds of ticket choppers, who manned subway entrances and checked riders’ paper tickets.",https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/05/17/mta-weighing-replacements-for-nyc-subway-turnstiles-in-bid-to-combat-growing-fare-evasion-problem/
"LIRR riders increasingly didn't pay for tickets, costing MTA $1.4 million",2023-11-19 10:00:00+00:00,"The Long Island Rail Road last year handed out more than 100,000 invoices to passengers who said they could not pay for their train tickets — a nearly 30% increase compared with 2019, when the railroad carried substantially more riders, LIRR statistics show. Even while billing riders for nearly $1.4 million in unpaid tickets last year, the railroad got back less than $60,000 of the delinquent fares, according to railroad figures. Acknowledging that the railroad’s antiquated system of sending nonpaying LIRR riders home with IOUs ""isn't working,"" Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman and CEO Janno Lieber has vowed change, including in the form of stepped-up police enforcement. The number of fare evasion arrests across the MTA's two railroads have already tripled compared to last year, MTA officials said. “The MTA Police is looking at how they handle the situation where someone is basically refusing to pay the fare,"" Lieber said in an interview at Jamaica last month, adding that the agency is looking for a solution in which fare beaters “don’t delay the train, but don’t get a free ride.” On Friday, Lieber condemned the invoices in the strongest terms yet, saying it's important that there's confidence in the system. ""You see people who aren’t paying, it starts to raise the question, ‘Why am I the sucker who should be paying when these other cats aren’t?’"" he said at a Long Island Association meeting in Melville. Under LIRR policy, passengers who say they are unable to pay for a ticket are issued an ""invoice for fare not paid,"" also known as an ""ADL 6009"" form, and directed to mail payment to the railroad. According to data obtained by Newsday through state public records laws, the number of invoices issued by LIRR conductors to riders rose by 28.6%, from 78,075 in 2019 to 100,417 in 2022, and was on pace to grow significantly higher this year. Meanwhile, the number of invoices eventually returned with payment has shrunk during that time, from 14% in 2019 to 5% last year. The LIRR's figures show it billed riders who did not pay for their tickets onboard $1,384,851 last year. That's up 31% from $1,053,490 in 2019. Ridership fell from a modern record 91.1 million in 2019 to 52.5 million in 2022, a 42% decrease. The railroad collected $59,790 of last year's delinquent fares, around 6%. And the problem was only getting worse during the first part of 2023, according to the LIRR’s figures. Through the first five months of this year, the LIRR already issued 55,200 invoices — 70% more than it did during the first five months of 2022. The railroad billed for a total of $767,954 during the first five months of 2023, and only collected $24,133 of that — or 3.14%. As fare evasion has risen on the LIRR, so too have frustrations among paying customers, who in August saw their latest fare hike. East Rockaway commuter Steven Burger said that since returning to being a full-time commuter about three months following the COVID-19 pandemic, he sees conductors handing out invoices to riders who refuse to pay their fares “all the time.” “And every time, I’m like, ‘They’re not paying that.’ Why would they?” said Burger, who believes, in recent years many riders have “wised up and figured out you can do this.” Burger added: ""It’s a terrible system. But I couldn’t tell you a better one.” The MTA said fare evasion costs about $700 million a year across its agencies, including New York City subways, buses, Metro-North and the LIRR. Lieber on Friday called the system a “bureaucratic” means of addressing a problem. “On the Long Island Rail Road, there’s this historic pattern of effectively giving out IOUs. Very quaint, right? Somebody says, ‘I'm not paying,’ and you say, ‘Here's a little piece of paper. Send your money,’” Lieber said. “These are fare evaders. You need to give them tickets. And people who are repetitive need to be subject to arrest and to be ejected from the train . . . We are moving in that direction.” In May, the MTA released a report prepared by a panel of experts that analyzed the problem of fare evasion, and proposed strategies to deal with it. Among them, setting up physical ""fare gates,"" as are in place at commuter railroads in Boston, New Jersey, and St. Louis, that require riders to present their tickets before boarding. The report acknowledged that “allowing customers to receive invoices for payment by mail is one of the most difficult and challenging evasion issues” facing its two railroads, and may even encourage fare beating. “The list of customers with a documented history of fare evasion is lengthy, particularly on the LIRR,” the report said. “This suggests that some customers have become aware of the onboard invoicing option and are deliberately exploiting it to effectively ride for free.” Following the release of the report, MTA officials said they worked with railroad unions and police to devise a new strategy to deal with fare disputes — having cops more frequently remove nonpaying customers from trains and addressing the situation at a station platform, including, if necessary, through an arrest. According to MTA Police figures, through Oct. 31, fare evasion arrests across the authority's two railroads — the LIRR and Metro-North — were up 210%, from 72 in the first 10 months of 2022 to 223 during the same period this year. Summonses for failure to pay a fare or present a ticket also doubled during that period, from 253 to 516. “What we realized is, we’re going into the trains and looking at the fare evaders as a dispute and trying to solve the problem on the train. Hence, we’re inconveniencing thousands of passengers,” MTA Chief of Police John Mueller said. “When we looked at that, we said, ‘This is upside down. And what we have to do is we have to now take the fare evader off the train.’ ” Mueller said fare disputes are being resolved on a “case-by-case” basis, with penalties ranging from warnings to fines to jail time. Anthony Simon, who heads the union representing LIRR conductors, confirmed that police have been more involved in fare disputes as of late, but said several factors can determine whether a passenger is removed from a train, including weather, location and the availability of police. LIRR labor leaders have long called for increased police assistance in resolving fare disputes, especially as they sometimes result in hostility toward train crew members, as when an LIRR passenger who refused to pay his fare allegedly assaulted two conductors in Brooklyn in March. “The confrontations between our train crews and riders just unwilling to pay has led to an all-time high of harassments and assaults that we are feeling to this day,” said Simon, who called for a “realistic and enforceable policy to stop the blatant theft” of LIRR service. That means moving away from an invoice system that has become “unmanageable due to the lack of consequences for repeat abusers,"" Simon said. A 2019 audit by the Office of State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli also criticized the invoice system, under which customers have 14 days to return payment before accruing penalties. After 60 days, riders with six or more offenses can have their cases sent to a collection agency. The invoice warns riders that nonpayment could result in ""a negative credit report."" But, the audit found, the LIRR “did not always follow up on invoices and only made limited efforts to find nonpaying riders.” The audit noted that the LIRR keeps a database of “the top 800 individuals who have requested seven or more Invoices with a total value of over $100.” Conductors are armed with the list, and must contact police if a person on it requests another invoice, according to the audit. But a memo circulated in April by the conductors’ union — the International Association of Sheet Metal Air, Rail and Transportation Workers — points out that passengers need not provide identification in order to be issued an ADL 6009 invoice. “As long as a passenger shows a willingness to pay, provides a name and address, and is not on the ADL offender list, it may be issued,” the union wrote. The union memo also illustrates conductors’ reluctance to escalate fare disputes on trains, telling members they should “never tell a passenger they must exit the train” nor “threaten with or say the word ‘police.’ ” LIRR Commuter Council chairman Gerard Bringmann has advocated for getting police more involved in fare disputes, but also acknowledged that doing so could delay a train and inconvenience “the people who are paying their fares, which is the vast majority.” While acknowledging that “there is no simple solution,” Bringmann commended the MTA for acknowledging that fare evasion on the LIRR “has gotten a little bit out of control, so it has to be addressed.” “All businesses write off a little bit of loss, just like your local retailer writes off ‘X’ amount for shoplifting. This is the mass transit version of shoplifting,” Bringmann said. “Now you can’t [write it off] because word gets around … ‘They’ll give you an invoice and you don’t have to pay it.’ So, now it has to be addressed.” Although the invoice system remains in place, the increased police involvement means the railroad's reliance on it has been ""reduced dramatically,"" Mueller said. MTA officials said they are taking other measures to address fare evasion on the LIRR, including by deploying new ticket collecting strategies and increasing messaging to riders about fare payment options, including through the MTA’s mobile app, TrainTime. The transit authority is reviewing other recommendations from its panel of fare evasion experts, including creating a system of increasing fines for repeat fare evaders, and working with lawmakers and prosecutors to increase penalties for frequent offenders. MTA Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee executive director Lisa Daglian, who sat on the fare evasion panel, noted that some of the recommendations aim to address underlying “equity” issues. That could include discounting fares for passengers up to 17 years old, and creating a government-subsidized reduced fare program in Nassau and Suffolk counties, similar to New York City’s “Fair Fares.” “Bringing a program like that to the railroad would help increase the number of people who could afford to ride the railroad,” said Daglian, who agreed the railroad should move away from responding to fare evasion with an IOU. “It’s a relic. It’s legacy,” Daglian said. “It’s definitely a system that doesn’t work.”

MTA officials held a roundtable discussion in the Jamaica Central Control Building on Thursday, Sept. 12, to provide an overview of the agency’s current and future plans for its extensive transportation system. The officials invited reporters from a handful of local media organizations to the event, including QNS, which was an on-the-record presentation and Q&A session covering topics affecting Queens residents and commuters across the five boroughs.

Top MTA officials, including MTA President and CEO Janno Lieber, Interim MTA President Demetrius Crichlow, Chief Customer Officer Shanifah Rieara and LIRR President Rob Free, led the discussion.

Much of the 90-minute-long discussion centered around plans for an inter-borough light rail project connecting Queens and Brooklyn, the renewal of its Capital Program and other initiatives.

The Interborough Expressway (IBX) is a proposed light rail project connecting underserved parts of Queens and Brooklyn. The pre-existing rail line of the LIRR Bay Ridge Branch and CSX-owned Fremont Secondary freight line, which extends from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, would connect to Jackson Heights.

Lieber said the MTA has completed a round of planning and outreach, with over 20 public outreach events communicating the station’s location and how its alignment could go through a particular neighborhood.

The project is currently in a more detailed design phase, including deciding on what real estate would be acquired to complete it. The MTA’s operations planning team is also researching how buses and connecting points could better service the neighborhoods that would connect to the IBX.

According to Lieber, 48 bridges would need to be renovated, expanded or redesigned for the IBX. Furthermore, he said the agency is still years away from being able to order cars or contract for construction. However, the agency remains hopeful that the next capital program will include a significant investment.

Lieber said the current focus is on investing in “what we call a state of good repair, the system that we have to make sure it doesn’t fall apart. That’s the first priority,” he said. “If we get enough money for that, we hope and expect that we will also make major progress towards constructing the IBX.”

The meeting also covered the renewal of the MTA’s Capital Program, which expires at the end of this year. The next legislative session in Albany will determine whether the MTA will have a fully funded capital plan for 2025-2029.

Lieber said the next capital plan needs to include funding for new Long Island Railroad and subway cars, as rolling stock is aging out. “We now have 1,500 railcars that have passed 40 years in age. When they get that old when they exceed their useful life, they break down much more frequently,” he said. “We have to replace 4,000 cars over the next 20 years. So, cars are going to be a big part of what we’re asking the leadership of the state of New York and Albany to help us fund.”

Likewise, buses also need an upgrade. Buses last around 12 years, and the entire fleet of around 6,000 buses must be replaced within the next 20 years.

Lieber is also advocating for increasing the number of ADA-accessible subway stations. So far, the MTA has accelerated the installation of elevators in subway stations five times as fast as previous administrations through funding from the current Capital Program. Furthermore, Lieber added that the MTA must invest in modernizing non-customer-facing entities, including its signal and power system.

Lieber reports that subway, bus and LIRR ridership has regained strength since the pandemic.

Subway and LIRR ridership is 80% of pre-COVID ridership, and buses are 90%, which Lieber said is tied to great service. “The subway service is the best it’s been in in a decade. Long Island Railroad and Metro North are running an average of 97% on-time performance.” Lieber added that despite media coverage of high-profile crimes, crime in the subway system is down 11% versus pre-pandemic, 6% year-to-date and last week down 30% compared to the comparable week in 2023.

Despite high ridership numbers and low crime rates, Lieber acknowledged that the agency faces a fare evasion crisis: “The biggest threat we face right now, and I’m not shy about talking about it, even though it’s sometimes controversial, is fare evasion. We’re losing something like $700 million a year to fare evasion,” Lieber said.

Lieber said that early into his term as CEO, he assembled a panel of experts, including law enforcement officials, social justice leaders and New York City Schools Chancellor David Banks, to find solutions to fare evasion and address fare equity issues. The MTA developed the Fair Fares program, which allows residents below a certain income level to qualify for a 50% discount on New York City Transit.

“You never want fare evasion to be a crime of poverty. We have been really pushing this idea that people who are really low income can and should get discounts,” Lieber said.

To combat fare evasion, the MTA has increased NYPD enforcement in the subway system and hired unarmed guards to keep exit gates closed. Lieber reports that the MTA has seen a reduction in fare evasion at stations with unarmed guards.

The agency also began significant fare enforcement on buses. Lieber said within the last two weeks, the MTA has deployed NYPD, NYTAPD (MTA police) and unarmed EAGLE teams consisting of revenue enforcement agents to give out tickets.",https://qns.com/2024/09/mta-officials-transportation-plans-queens-jamaica-roundtable-discussion/
"MTA will redesign subway exit gates, the 'superhighway' for farebeaters: CEO",2022-12-06 16:42:11.616000+00:00,"NEW YORK (1010 WINS/WCBS 880) -- The MTA aims to completely redesign subway turnstiles and exit gates to stop farebeaters, as the agency is on track to lose $500 million this year alone in revenue to the scofflaws.

The idea is part of a sweeping crackdown on fare evasion that MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber said is being attacked ""from all fronts"" and just getting started, with farebeating arrests up nearly 100% over last year.

“We’re going to rely on the cops, we’re going to bring in gate guards, we’re going to redesign the system, we’re going to work with the district attorneys to have a more consistent pattern of enforcement—we’re on it,” Lieber told 1010 WINS Newsline With Brigitte Quinn on Tuesday.

Lieber put together a blue-ribbon panel earlier this year to study solutions to fare evasion. While the panel has yet to release its findings, Lieber said subway exit gates have become a “superhighway” for fare-dodgers and something has to be done.

“We are going to be redesigning this to make it much less easy to fare evade, especially that gate,” Lieber said. “When a hardworking person swipes their MetroCard or taps their OMNY and they see 10 people go by them through the gate, it makes you feel like a sucker, and I don’t want that to be the vibe in the subway system.”

He said the MTA expects to hear from the expert panel in the next month or so. “In the meantime, we’re hard at work figuring out how do we redesign the fare array, because it’s just too porous and it’s letting a lot of people in, and we have to have a different physical barrier to stop people from doing this.”

“We’ve all seen it and it is demoralizing,” Lieber said of farebeating. “It is destructive to the sense of fairness and fair play that animates New York, because we all share this space, and we all need the MTA to operate and be funded. And it’s also contributing to the sense of disorder in the system.”

“And the turnstiles—frankly, it seems like we’re trying to cultivate a generation of world class gymnasts, because you just put your hands on the side and you vault over them,” Lieber continued. “We’ve got to deal with that, whether it’s raising the height or changing the design so it’s not so easy for people to literally just vault and kick their legs over. We’ve seen people even in business suits. And I don’t want any more latte-carrying office workers to go do the limbo under the turnstile either.”

“Once that gate is open, it’s like Black Friday at Macy’s,” Robert Diehl, the MTA’s senior vice president of safety and security, told board members at a meeting last week.

Any redesign of the subway turnstiles and exit gates would likely require significant financial investment, even as the MTA faces a $3 billion budget hole in 2025, with weekday subway ridership still hovering at 60% of pre-pandemic levels.

San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit, which operates a system much smaller than the MTA, has budgeted $90 million to replace fare gates systemwide.

The MTA has recently stationed private security guards, some of them armed, in at least 14 stations across the subway system.

Unarmed guards at 12 stations make sure the exit gates stay closed, unless they’re being used for emergencies or by fare-paying riders who have items like strollers, luggage or wheelchairs.

At last week’s board meeting, the MTA said the armed guards will save the agency about $100,000 a month in additional fare revenue at the two Brooklyn stations.

“What we’re really trying to stop is that opportunist,” Diehl told board members last week. “It’s that person that once the gates open, sees three people go through and says, ‘Hey, why not me?’ And then you’ve got eight people behind that person coming through.”

Diehl said he’s seen would-be farebeaters give up and swipe their MetroCards as the guards watched the exit gates at the Roosevelt Avenue/74th Street station in Jackson Heights and the West Fourth Street–Washington Square station in Greenwich Village.

“People come up, they queue up, they’re waiting, they’re waiting, and the gate doesn’t open,” Diehl said. “And all of the sudden, they pull out MetroCards and they go through the turnstile.”

It's not only the guards that are cracking down on fare evasion. The NYPD's fare-evasion arrests are up 97% this year compared to 2021, according to the department.

The city has begun treating fare evasion with new urgency, as the crime has grown even more rampant during the COVID-19 pandemic and is expected to cost the MTA some $500 million in revenue in 2022 alone.

The MTA is also looking to tackle farebeating on buses, which is far worse than in the subway. According to the MTA, 29.3% of bus riders skipped the fare between July and September, compared to 13.4% of subway riders in that period.

"Delays, violent crime: Report card on NYC subway reveals a system in crisis",2024-03-09 00:00:00,"If you slogged around during the first month of 2024 on the subways, you probably felt like there was a major delay every way you turned, and when you did get on the train, you were one wrong flicker of eye contact away from being a crime victim.

With subway ridership hovering around 71% of pre-COVID normal, bus ridership at 60% of normal, and commuter rail at about three-quarters, we don’t want to lose any more riders to bad service or fear.

8 National Guard members such as these are now patrolling NYC’s subway system as crime hits new heights. AP

But keeping straphangers riding the MTA will take work, just as the system has never felt more imperiled. So imperiled, in fact, that New York Gov. Kathy Huchul announced this past week that she’s calling in the National Guard to keep passengers safe.

So just how is the MTA — and the state and city governments responsible for running it and keeping it safe – doing?

Crime: F. Crime skyrocketed this year. We’ve now had three murders on the rails, all random. In January, felony crime was up 47%, compared to the same month last year. Grand larcenies rose, but subway riders and workers also suffered 110 violent felonies, up 16 percent. Compare violent felonies to January 2019, before the end of cash bail for many crimes and other criminal-justice “reforms,” and serious violence is up 61%.

8 During the first month of 2024, major crime was up nearly 50% in the subway system. Not a good start — nor a good look. REUTERS

Crime affects service: last Friday, after the slashing of an MTA conductor on the A line, workers walked off the line for a few hours. Last year, bus and subway workers suffered 135 assaults, up from 125 in 2022.

Disorder: D. Last year, the MTA lost $700 million on fare evasion; 46% and 13% of bus and subway riders refuse to pay.

The issue isn’t just money. Chronic fare evaders are disproportionately people who are aggressively panhandling, using drugs, and committing violence.

Now, we’ve got a new element of disorder: migrants, including children, walking platforms and trains selling candy.

8 MTA chief Janno Lieber (wearing a tie.) REUTERS

MTA chief Janno Lieber and New York City Transit head Richard Davey say the right things every chance they get — that disorder and violence are a crisis. The three recent fatal shootings on the subway are “completely unacceptable,” Davey said in February.

But they are not in charge of the criminal justice system. Davey observed that of the four people arrested so far for seven assaults on transit employees this year, “they have 50 arrests” among them, including recent arrests and immediate releases.

City and state follow-through on crime and fare evasion: F. Only the state legislature and Gov. Huchul can create criminal justice procedures to ensure that recidivist criminals remain behind bars, and only Mayor Adams can help ensure that severely mentally ill people are securely in care.

Police are doing their job: NYPD transit chief Michael Kemper notes that “all categories of enforcement are at or near historic highs,” with 1,533 transit arrests in January, 31% higher than in the pre-“reform” era of January 2019, and 16,504 summons, 74% higher than in 2019. Police have recovered 17 guns from lawbreakers in transit this year.

But, says Kemper, suspects are “back out … sometimes within hours.”

Police can arrest suspects quickly because the MTA has blanketed its system – stations, and, now, subways and buses – with cameras; the third subway murder of this year, a February shooting on a Bronx train, was filmed. Cameras aren’t deterring crime, though.

And: the mayor’s periodic surges of police officers into subways, whenever the public starts to scream about violence, depend on unsustainable overtime. The mayor needs to level with New Yorkers that we need more police.

Service disruptions: C. The subways suffered 74 “major incidents” in January: a signal, track, or other malfunction that disrupted 50 trains or more.

These 74 incidents represented the worst performance since July 2018, when the MTA, recovering from chronic maintenance mismanagement that had resulted in the “summer of hell” the year before, suffered 77 incidents.

8 One of two recent train derailments that have befallen the city’s subway system. AP

Some of these incidents have to do with preventable disruptive behavior, such as people walking on tracks: 25 such incidents were the second-highest in eight years.

But the rest don’t. Including two recent derailments, they indicate an operations problem.

The disruptions pushed the MTA’s “percentage of service delivered” to a twelve-month average of 94.1 percent, in line with last year. In the year before COVID-19, it was above 95 percent. But when the train does run, it (mostly) runs as intended – 83.4% of customer trips got there within five minutes of schedule in January. But this average is lower than the 84.8% riders enjoyed last year.

Service flexibility: A-. As weekend and off-peak riders have returned more quickly than weekday commuters post-COVID, the MTA has increased weekend trains, from eight to six minutes on the #1 and #6, and from 10-12 to 8-10 minutes on some lettered lines. This can mean the difference between a five-minute wait and a frustrated trip back upstairs to a taxi.

8 Across the MTA, subway ridership is hovering around 71% of pre-COVID normal, while bus ridership is at 60% of normal. AP

As the city looks to build more housing, the state, city, and MTA must work to add service before cars get packed like they were in 2015, sending people to Uber.

The MTA can add service partly because the state increased a payroll tax on city jobs last year, raising $1.1 billion. A tax increase is not optimal; it would be better to operate more efficiently.

Weather: A-. Amazingly, it snowed, in February, with four to eight inches one weekday, and amazingly, the MTA ran well. A new part of resilience to weather is people just staying home: only 2.3 million people rode the trains during the snow, 1.6 million fewer than the post-COVID normal. Last fall, too, during one of our now-regular rain torrents, the MTA decided to shut down or suspend chunks of the system, rather than lure more people into a flood. The MTA has spent billions to protect its physical assets from long-term weather damage, but trains are still underground, and vulnerable to inundation: keeping more people home a couple of times a year, and out of harm’s way, is a good strategy.

8 The snake-like interiors of the new R211 subway cars help facilitate easier passenger flow between cars. Matthew McDermott

Cool new things: A. The MTA has started running brand-new open-gangway R211T subway cars. Take the C line, and you’ll happen upon a train whose cars you can walk through. Eventually, this could be good for security; an MTA worker could continuously walk up and down, calling in disorder to police a few stations ahead. And though LED lights in stations don’t qualify as cool, they are cheaper and less harsh than old-fashioned lighting.

Head-scratching new things: B-. In January, Washington Heights commuters noticed a bright yellow metal gate blocking riders on the platform from the tracks below, with an opening for the train doors. It’s not the most attractive thing, and it’s not feasible in some stations. But the barriers will prevent falls and, perhaps, violence. The gates are cheaper than spending billions of dollars on sliding glass platform doors.

As for the weird orange flexi-bollards the MTA has erected at a Harlem station to protect the conductor from attacks: this image is one of desperation rather than innovation. Stop attacks by prosecuting attackers.

8 New platform safety barriers are intended to prevent accidents. MTA/ Flickr

New walk-through fare gates at the Sutphin Boulevard–Archer Avenue–JFK Airport station fall somewhere in the middle: they’re far easier for handicapped people and those with strollers and luggage to navigate than old-fashioned turnstiles – but they’ve proven easily hack-able when it comes to fare evasion. The problem is that no design is going to prevent theft. The transit system is not a prison, designed to be hard to enter and exit. Just as with violence, the fix for theft is enforcement.

Bus speeds: C. During Covid, people who rode the bus regularly got a smoother(er) ride: with fewer passengers to board, with payment suspended, and will less traffic, bus speeds flirted with 9mph. They’ve steadily fallen, back to barely 8.1mph.

The MTA is trying to speed up buses, with more enforcement against cars blocking the way; most drivers stop blocking the bus lane or bus stop after they’ve received just one camera-generated ticket.

8 The MTA’s new fare-capping system is helping commuters save cash but still has room for improvement.

The MTA should also speed up buses by speeding up boarding: with OMNY readers now in place, let us board the backdoor and tap our card there. The MTA worries this will cause more fare evasion, but that fix is enforcement, not making it more inconvenient for people who do pay.

Fare flexibility: B. It’s good that the MTA has started “fare capping,” where, if you ride 12 times in a week, your rides after that are free. And it’s good that after criticism, the MTA allowed people to start their “fare capping” week on any day, not just Monday. The MTA needs to expand this flexibility to reward people over a certain number of monthly rides, as well, and maybe give people a bonus ride, regardless of time frame, after, say, every 30 rides.

The MTA’s overall grade remains I for incomplete. Over decades, subway, bus, and commuter-rail quality has risen and fallen with political attention and resources.

Historically, it’s taken a big crisis – like the 2017 “summer of hell” — to get politicians to get the MTA to reverse any slippage.

With service, we’re nowhere near crisis– as long as January’s disruptions remain an aberration. With crime, though, we are in what now seems to be a permanent crisis. The train is (mostly) on time, but far more dangerous than it was four years ago.

Turnstile Hopper Assaults Transit Worker In Midtown: Police,2024-09-16 16:47:29+00:00,"Crime & Safety Turnstile Hopper Assaults Transit Worker In Midtown: Police The assault occurred as the MTA cracks down on fare evasion across the city's massive transit system.

(Maya Kaufman/Patch)

MIDTOWN, NY – A 52-year-old woman was hospitalized after she was assaulted by a man who jumped a subway turnstile at the Lexington Avenue-53rd Street station in Midtown East at approximately 6:15 a.m. on Monday morning, a, a police spokesperson told Patch.

The woman, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) employee, was shoved and punched in the face, police said, falling to the floor and hitting her head. She was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital in stable condition, according to police.

A spokesperson for the MTA confirmed that the employee is a customer service agent at the station. The incident, which police said occurred on the mezzanine level of the E/M station at 53rd Street, comes amidst increased enforcement of fare evasion – turnstile hopping – in the subway system and, more recently, on the city's buses.

No arrests have been made and an investigation is ongoing. Crackdown Comes With A Cost Fare evasion may have cost the MTA as much as $690 million in 2022, and the bill for 2023 could exceed $700 million, according to a recent report.

But the recent crackdown, while aimed at reducing lost revenue, has also raised concerns about the increased dangers transit workers face as confrontations with fare evaders become more frequent, concerns compounded by the on the job hazards the city's transit workers already experience. According to a study published in the Journal of Urban Health in August, between 2020 and 2023 approximately 89 percent of New York City's transit workers reported some form of harassment or assault while on the job.

Nearly half – 48.6 percent – said they’d been physically assaulted at work. [UPDATE: Researchers from New York University have retracted the study referenced above, stating that it was ""compromised."" More information is available here.] The study follows a report from the Urban Institute, which found that assaults on transit workers resulting in fatalities or hospitalizations nationwide tripled between 2008 and 2022. Asked for comment regarding the danger the MTA's crackdown on fare evasion across the system poses to transit workers, a spokesperson referred Patch to remarks made by MTA CEO Janno Lieber at a press conference on Sunday. “...I have to remind New Yorkers that because of the work that we've all been doing under this team's leadership, crime is down in the subway,” Lieber said.",https://patch.com/new-york/midtown-nyc/turnstile-hopper-assaults-transit-worker-midtown-police
Penner: The MTA One Metro New York ongoing delays,2023-08-10 00:00:00,"Listen to this article Listen to this article

New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chairman Janno Lieber’s celebration of the billionth rider using the One Metro New York (OMNY) fare payment to board the New York City subway system last month was premature. In 2017, the MTA awarded a $573 million contract to Cubic Transportation Systems to replace the Metro Card. New OMNY fare collection technology was originally promised to be coming online between 2019 and 2023. This date has come and gone. OMNY was designed to speed up passenger boarding. Its primary purpose is to replace the MetroCard, which New Yorkers have used to swipe since 1993 into the MTA New York City subway, bus and Staten Island Railway transit systems.

In 2022, the MTA lost over $600 million to fare evasion. There is no indication in 2023 that this financial loss will be significantly reduced. Neither Hochul nor Lieber is able to explain how the introduction of OMNY in coming years will end routine fare evasion as it continues to flourish today.

Over the past few years, there has been a series of MTA management changes, programming challenges and changing priorities that have all contributed to project implementation delays. Over time, the base contract cost for installation of the new OMNY fare system has grown to $645 million. It has also fallen several years behind the original agreed upon base line schedule between the MTA and contractor. The project is currently $130 million over budget. Who knows what additional costs may be incurred in coming years? The MTA has never made public any agreed upon detailed recovery schedule from the contractor. This would indicate how the lost time would be made up. It would include resource allocations by the contractor and the MTA to meet the latest recovery schedule. The MTA is incurring additional costs for its own project management staff and McKissack, the engineering consulting firm providing additional oversight of the contractor for several years beyond what was anticipated. Will the MTA file a claim with the contractor for compensation of these costs?

Costs may continue to grow based upon any change orders due to unforeseen site conditions or last-minute changes in technology or scope requested by maintenance or operations groups to the base contracts during the course of construction.

Long Island Rail Road and Metro North Rail Road may not reach substantial completion for installation and use of OMNY until late 2025. Contractors may submit delay claims against the MTA for insufficient facility access, NYC Transit, LIRR or Metro North staff support. Commuters and taxpayers may never know the true final cost for OMNY for several more years after the system is in full use agency wide.

Another critical failure of OMNY, that Hochul, Lieber or their predecessors never acknowledge, is the failure to come to any agreement for integration of OMNY with NJ Transit, Port Authority Trans Hudson (PATH) subway and NYC Economic Development Corporation private ferry fare collection systems.

The MTA’s previous plan to phase out the MetroCard in 2023 has been delayed until at least 2025. A majority of riders are still using the Metro Card versus OMNY. While almost 50% of subway riders are using OMNY, far fewer are doing the same for those commuters boarding New York City Transit Bus, Manhattan Bronx Surface Bus Authority and MTA Bus.

MTA’s OMNY trials and tribulations will continue for years to come.

MTA clarifies congestion pricing exemptions ahead of Wednesday vote,2024-03-25 00:00:00,"Some private buses and school buses will be exempt from the congestion pricing toll, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

Initially, the Traffic Mobility Review Board said that private buses would not be exempt. But bus companies that run regular schedules like Megabus and Hampton Jitney will now be exempt.

What You Need To Know The Metropolitan Transportation Authority says that private commuter buses, school buses and city vehicles used by some employees will be exempt from the congestion pricing toll Meanwhile, the NYPD is deploying hundreds of additional officers into the subway system as part of a weeklong effort to crack down on fare evasion, officials said Monday The MTA is also focusing on fare evasion on buses, piloting video screens on 100 buses so passengers can see they are being recorded in the hopes of deterring them from not paying or assaulting a driver

The BUS4NYC advocacy group is happy with the choice. Many of the companies in the coalition average 750 trips into the congestion pricing zone each week.

“We are providing a public service to the riding public and were pleased and happy to see that the MTA recognizes that,"" said BUS4NYC Vice President Patrick Condren. ""And we support the MTA in any congestion mitigation issues because buses with 55 people on a bus is clearly congestion mitigation.”

The MTA has also clarified that in addition to emergency vehicles, some other cars in the city’s fleet, like those used by case workers for the Administration for Children's Services and building inspectors, will be exempt from the toll.

The toll for most cars driving into the area below 60th Street is expected to be $15 if the driver has an E-ZPass tag. Those without E-ZPasses will pay $22.50 to drive into the Central Business District.

The toll is expected to go into effect this June, barring a judge ruling against the MTA in any one of the four lawsuits filed to stop the plan. The MTA board will vote Wednesday on the congestion pricing plan.

Meanwhile, the NYPD is making progress on subway crime. NYPD Chief of Transit Michael Kemper said at a committee meeting Monday that crime has dropped since January, when it was up nearly 50% when compared to the same time period last year.

Kemper also announced “Operation Fare Play” Monday, which will send hundreds of additional police officers into the subway system as part of a weeklong effort to crack down on fare evasion.

Kemper said Monday that fare evasion arrests have led to 11 of the 20 gun arrests so far this year in the subway system.

But fare evasion above ground is also a problem, with nearly 50% of customers not paying on buses as of the end of 2023.

The MTA is responding by installing real-time video screens on 100 buses as part of a pilot program to increase fare collection and safety.

“It’s a deterrent, number one,” said New York City Transit President Richard Davey. “And a reminder that if you do something on our system, we have the opportunity to catch you on camera and bring that to the authorities for appropriate attention, arrest and maybe prosecution.”",https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/traffic_and_transit/2024/03/25/mta-clarifies-congestion-pricing-exemptions-ahead-of-wednesday-vote
Prototype of turnstile gate to combat NYC fare-beating installed at Grand Central,2023-05-16 00:00:00,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is preparing to roll out prototypes of new turnstile designs that are harder to jump over or sneak under as it seeks to crack down on fare-beating, which costs the agency an estimated $500 million annually.

At least two demonstration models have been installed in the famed Vanderbilt Hall at Grand Central Terminal — devices the agency has attempted to shield from public view by erecting a curtain that effectively walls off half the massive space from commuters passing through.

The curtain was tightly guarded on Monday by roughly a dozen MTA staffers — including spokesmen, police officers and other employees — all of whom made a concerted effort to keep reporters, photographers and transit buffs from gleaning glimpses of the devices through cracks in the sheets of fabric before the still yet-to-be-scheduled unveiling.

An MTA spokesman refused all requests for comment on Monday.

A Post reporter was able to make out the tale-tell signs of at least two models through the MTA’s blockade.

A model of the new MTA turnstile that is designed to prevent fare beating. Obtained by the New York Post

The word of the coming overhaul first leaked late Sunday night when a Reddit user posted a photo of one of the new demo models in Grand Central — the train hub’s historic chandeliers could be seen in a reflection captured in the image.

It includes large doors that swing open and stretch several feet high, making them much more difficult to jump over.

The model is said to be nearly identical to the fare gates recently bought by the national French railroad and installed at one of its key transit hubs in Paris, which are manufactured by the same firm, Conduent Transport Solutions.

French officials say the design can handle more than 30 people per minute, and they hope it will cut fare evasion in half.

Conduent’s gates have already caught the eye of Philadelphia’s transit agency, which announced earlier this year it was spending nearly $1 million to install them in two metro stations as part of a pilot project to try and reduce fare-beating.

A spokesman for the company did not respond to a request for comment.

Meanwhile, the second model spotted through the curtain by The Post reporter includes the large green arrows used by the new fare gates recently installed in Boston’s commuter railroad stations, which are similar to the system used by the London Underground.",https://nypost.com/2023/05/16/turnstile-prototype-to-fight-fare-beating-seen-at-grand-central/

MTA fare free bus pilot: See which Staten Island route was selected,2023-07-17 18:40:19.250000+00:00,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Riders of five New York City bus routes, including one on Staten Island, will soon be commuting free-of-charge.

Gov. Kathy Hochul unveiled the five MTA bus routes that have been selected for the agency’s fare free pilot program on Monday that was included in the most recent state budget.

On Staten Island, the MTA has selected the S46/96, which operates between South Avenue, West Shore Plaza Shopping Center and the St. George Ferry Terminal, serving roughly 60,000 riders per month, according to MTA data.

“By establishing these fare free bus pilot routes, we are expanding access to public transportation across the city and improving transit equity to better serve all New Yorkers,” Hochul said.

Starting in late September, riders of the selected bus routes will not be required to pay fares upon boarding for anywhere from six months to a year.

“We have championed innovation and creative thinking across the transportation network and look forward to seeing how New Yorkers respond to this pilot program,” said MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber.

Said State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton (D-North Shore/South Brooklyn): “This pilot program is a significant step towards a more equitable transportation system here in New York City. In a similar way to the Staten Island Ferry system, this Free Fare Bus Route will help keep commutes affordable for residents.”

“This initiative will provide significant benefits to the diverse communities it serves, prioritizing equity, accessibility, and affordability, and will enhance mass transit options for thousands of riders who rely on buses every day,” added Councilmember Kamillah Hanks (D-North Shore).

Other routes selected for the pilot program include the Bx18 A/B in the Bronx, the B60 in Brooklyn, the M116 in Manhattan and the Q4 LCL/LTD in Queens.

Routes were chosen based on a variety of factors including equity for low-income communities, ridership, fare evasion rates and access to major employers and commercial centers.

“Our team worked hard to ensure the five routes that were chosen for this pilot will benefit New Yorkers who rely on buses to get them where they need to go,” said New York City Transit President Richard Davey.

All buses included in the pilot program will be clearly marked with “Fare Free” signage and will have their fareboxes and OMNY readers covered for the duration of the pilot.

The agency noted that the pilot program will not include free transfers to other buses or subway lines, meaning those with a multi-legged commute will still need to pay a fare.",https://www.silive.com/news/2023/07/mta-fare-free-bus-pilot-see-which-staten-island-route-was-selected.html
Members of Congress ask Hochul to fund more fare-free buses amid state budget negotiations – QNS,2024-04-06 09:00:50-04:00,"Sign up for our QNS email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

In a letter to NYS Governor Kathy Hochul, ten members of Congress collectively requested $45 million in funding for the expansion of the city’s fare-free bus pilot program.

The request, dated April 1, was led by Queens Rep. Grace Meng and Rep. Dan Goldman, whose district is in Manhattan and Brooklyn. It was delivered to the governor amid the current budget negotiations in Albany that will determine the funding allocations for the 2025 fiscal year.

Last year, the MTA rolled out the Fare-Free Bus Pilot program which designated one bus route in each borough as fare-free for up to a year. In Queens, the Q4 bus which runs from Jamaica to Cambria Heights has been fare-free for riders since Sept. 2023.

Still underway, the pilot seeks to give the MTA insights into how free service affects ridership rates, fare evasion and equity among public transit users. The initiative is also expected to speed up service by removing the time riders spend paying the fare and allowing additional entrance from the back door.

In the letter, they requested that $45 million be allocated in the state’s budget for fiscal year 2025 to expand the pilot with more routes across the city. They also requested an additional $45 million to increase the frequency and reliability of MTA buses across the city, which they cited as the slowest in the nation.

“Millions of New Yorkers and visitors rely on the MTA to access economic and educational opportunity. An expansion of the Fare-Free Bus Pilot with additional routes will give the MTA a more wholistic understanding of fare-free transit’s benefits in New York,” the lawmakers said in the letter.

All Queens representatives in Congress signed the letter, including Nydia Valazquez and Gregory Meeks. In the rest of the city, the letter was signed by Rep.

NEW YORK CITY — The MTA has unveiled its $68.4 billion capital plan for 2025-2029 as the agency looks to keep the system running amid an uncertain future after the June congestion pricing pause.

Gov. Kathy Hochul’s decision left the agency with a $16 billion gap to fill in its current five-year capital plan. Officials said its 2025-2029 plan will focus on improving accessibility, signal modernization, station renovations, track upgrades and areas in need of urgent investment, officials said.

The MTA in the proposed plan would bring in 1,500 new subway cars to the fleet and provide signal modernization and fare gates improvements. An estimated $5.4 billion will go to upgrading subway signals on the Broadway N, Q, R, W line, the Liberty and Rockaway A, S lines, and the Nassau J, Z line, according to the plan.

More than $1 billion will go to new fare gates to be put at 150 subway stations in the city. The new gates would aim to reduce fare evasion — which cost the agency a reported $300 million a year. The proposed plan calls for at least 60 more stations to be made ADA-accessible and 45 subway station elevators to be replaced.

“After years of underinvestment, more than 90% of this proposed plan – the largest in MTA history – focuses on bringing the system to a state of good repair,"" said MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber. ""These investments are necessary to serve the following generations and the future of the region’s economy, environment, and social and economic equity.” More than 150 stations will benefit from priority repairs, upgrades to customer communications, and enhanced security cameras. 10 stations will be fully renovated, and platform fencing will be installed at 100 stations.",https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/mta-unveils-65b-capital-plan-amid-uncertain-future-funding
NY’s MTA Sees $900 Million Gap as Fare Evasion Saps Revenue,2024-07-31 00:00:00,"Commuters during the morning rush hour at the Fulton Center subway station in New York, US, on Tuesday, July 30, 2024. New York Citys aging transit system needs 2,000 new subway and commuter rail cars, 60 miles of new subway tracks and upgraded power stations, according to the MTAs five-year capital plan.

(Bloomberg) -- New York City’s transit system is facing a projected $900 million combined deficit in 2027 and 2028 as persistent fare evasion dampens the agency’s revenue collections and real estate taxes fall short.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s subway, bus and commuter rail lines, is now expecting $811 million less in farebox revenue this year through 2027 — even after earlier budget revisions — as fare beating continues to plague the system, according to a presentation Wednesday during the agency’s monthly board meeting. About half of bus riders skip paying and 14% of subway users scurry through open emergency exits or manipulate turnstiles to avoid the fare.

The MTA also said it now anticipates $790 million less this year through 2027 from mortgage recording taxes and property transfer taxes on commercial real estate sales.

The shortfall estimate is an abrupt change from last year, when state lawmakers directed more revenue to the MTA to help balance the largest US mass-transit provider’s operating budgets through 2027. Transit officials say they’re on track to meet operating efficiencies that will cut expenses by $400 million this year and $500 million annually starting in 2025.

“We still need to get more riders to the system and do better on fare evasion,” Kevin Willens, the MTA’s chief financial officer said Tuesday during a press briefing on the new budget forecast. “If we don’t get continued ridership growth and we don’t do better on fare evasion, the revenues might have to come down even more.”

The budget forecasts includes anticipated farebox and toll increases of 4% in 2025 and 2027. While subway and bus revenue and real estate tax receipts are expected to underperform — conversely — commuter rail revenue and bridge and tunnel toll money is anticipated to increase and potential debt service savings in 2024 and 2025 will help to offset the budget challenges.

The MTA is revising its multi-year operating budget forecast as it must also wait for state lawmakers to resolve a shortfall in its 2020 — 2024 capital plan, which funds infrastructure upgrades for a more than 100-year-old system. The transit agency was forced to defer $16.5 billion worth of capital improvements after Governor Kathy Hochul in June paused a congestion pricing plan that was set to begin June 30 and would have provided $15 billion for MTA’s infrastructure needs.

Janno Lieber, the MTA’s chief executive officer, is determined to maintain the necessary infrastructure investments to avoid returning to years past when the system suffered from excessive delays.

“I’d be damned if I’m going to personally let it go down, let the system go backwards without a fight,” Lieber said during the board meeting about the capital program. “That’s what we got. That’s what we’ve got on our agenda for the Fall.”

While the governor has pledged to resolve MTA’s funding gaps, its financial outlook could darken even more because the forecast doesn’t include the impact of Hochul and the legislature either not restarting the tolling initiative or failing to provide an alternative funding source.

If that happens, the MTA’s operating budget would need to take on debt-service costs earlier than anticipated because it would have to borrow from revenue that flows through that spending plan rather than selling congestion pricing bonds that would be repaid with the new toll. Instead of principal and interest expenses rising in 2030, they would increase by $150 million in 2027 and $300 million in 2028, according to the updated budget forecast.

Next year’s spending plan would need to absorb as much as $200 million of one-time labor expenses as the cost of some employees would shift to the operating budget from the capital plan. Recurring maintenance expenses would increase by as much as $260 million.

There would also be $70 million less in farebox revenue as the system wouldn’t get the expected ridership jolt from commuters ditching their cars for public transportation to avoid a congestion toll.

The MTA’s finances also face risks aside from the pause on congestion pricing. A 5% lower recovery in paid ridership would mean $325 million of less farebox revenue, a slower economy or sluggish real estate recovery could reduce dedicated tax collections by as much as $750 million. MTA’s future budgets also depend on $500 million of revenue beginning in 2026 from casinos that have yet to be developed.

“I’m optimistic that the decision makers in Albany, all of them, understand the need and that they will respond,” Lieber said. “We can’t let the system slide back to where it was in the 1970s or even back to 2017, the ‘Summer of Hell’.”

Congestion pricing pause adds to LIRR maintenance as MTA projects future deficit,2024-07-31 15:37:35.256000+00:00,"Gov. Kathy Hochul’s abrupt pause on congestion pricing, which has already blown a $16.5 billion hole in the MTA’s capital budget, will cost the transit authority hundreds of millions more in operating dollars, including $20 million more in annual maintenance costs for old Long Island Rail Road trains that won’t be replaced.

The loss of the tolling plan is compounding an increasingly bleak financial picture for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is now forecasting deficits of more than $400 million three years from now, driven by disappointing tax revenues and worsening fare evasion on buses and subways.

While MTA officials suggested it was premature to discuss the potential impact from the future budget gaps, Lisa Daglian, executive director of the MTA’s Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, warned that losing the toll revenue “could lead to service cuts, layoffs and drastic fare increases.”

The latest fallout from Hochul’s decision to pull the plug on the Central Business District Tolling Program was detailed in the MTA’s update to its financial plan, released Wednesday.

WHAT TO KNOW Gov. Kathy Hochul's decision to pause congestion pricing, having already dealt a $16.5 billion blow to the MTA's capital budget, could cost the transit agency hundreds of millions more in additional operating costs, including from having to maintain aging LIRR train cars, officials said.

Hochul has pledged to find an alternative funding source to make up for the lost toll revenue. Without it, advocates said the MTA could face pressure to increase debt, cut service and raise fares.

In addition to the $1 billion in annual toll revenue the MTA was expecting from congestion pricing, nixing the effort comes with several other consequences for its operating budget, MTA officials said at their monthly board meeting.

Different than the capital budget, which is largely funded by borrowing and government aid that goes toward long-term infrastructure investments, the MTA's operating budget is largely paid for through tax revenue and fare and toll dollars that goes toward keeping the daily transit system running, including employee wages and fuel costs.

Among the impacts on the MTA's operating budget from losing congestion pricing: Adding up to $200 million in payroll for employees who would have been paid out of the capital budget; $90 million in infrastructure repair and emergency response calls that are expected because of deferred maintenance; and having to take on $300 million in new debt three years earlier than planned.

The loss of capital funding also means the LIRR will have to put off plans to purchase some new train cars and extend the life of its oldest fleet of trains, which are approaching their 40th birthday. Continuing to maintain those trains beyond this year will cost the railroad an extra $20 million annually, MTA officials said.

That news came days after LIRR President Robert Free on Monday laid out an ""unprecedented"" plan to improve service on the railroad, including reducing the need for transfers and boosting punctuality at Jamaica Station. Asked Wednesday whether the Reagan-era trains could hamstring his plan, Free acknowledged that ""the reliability of our equipment"" was a factor.

According to LIRR statistics, the railroad's 100 antiquated M3 train cars are the least reliable in the fleet, breaking down about once every 40,000 miles. In comparison, the LIRR's newest cars, the M9s, travel about 350,000 miles between breakdowns.

""If we were not able to continue buying new cars, which is a downside risk of the 'no congestion pricing, no substitute financing' scenario, then that could actually could impact performance and impact operating costs, because we'd have to do more to maintain those old cars,"" MTA Chairman Janno Lieber said Wednesday.

The MTA will similarly take on an additional $50 million to $150 million in recurring annual costs from keeping some old buses around longer than planned, officials said.

There was other bad news in the MTA’s midyear financial update, including bus and subway fare revenue coming in $98 million below budget, largely because of fare evasion, according to MTA Chief Financial Officer Kevin Willens. Dedicated taxes, which the MTA counted on to cover nearly half its $19.3 billion 2024 operating budget, are also well below projections, Willens said.

In a statement, Hochul spokesperson John Lindsay said the governor “remains committed to funding the MTA Capital Plan, and she is working with partners in government on funding mechanisms while congestion pricing is paused.”

Hochul’s office also pointed out that the MTA financial plan shows what could happen, not what will happen, and noted the transit agency’s multiple years of projected balanced budgets are due to Hochul last year saving the MTA from a “fiscal cliff” caused by ridership drops during the pandemic.

Lieber and other MTA leaders said Wednesday they would take Hochul at her word that she would find an alternative revenue source to make up for the lost toll revenue. Doing so would stave off most of the expected impacts on the MTA’s operating budget, but not all of them. The MTA would still lose $70 million in additional fare revenue that would have come from a boost in transit ridership caused by the new tolls, and $10 million in efficiencies the MTA was expecting from city buses being able to move faster through less-congested Manhattan streets.

On the plus side, fare revenue on the MTA’s commuter railroads, including the LIRR, is stronger than expected, as ridership has rebounded to around 80% of pre-COVID levels.

But that’s not enough to make up for other losses, which are predicted to result in the transit agency facing a $428 million annual operating deficit in 2027, growing to $469 million in 2028.

Buoyed by a $1 billion state bailout last year paid for by a state increase in payroll taxes, the MTA had previously predicted a balanced budget through at least 2027.

Trying to dissuade panic over the projections, Lieber said the MTA still has ""a couple years to resolve"" its fiscal challenges and is already taking steps to do so. The New York City Transit bus and subway system is on pace to hit its goal of $300 million in cost cutting this year, and the LIRR should achieve $60 million in savings, officials said.

Pushing back on that optimism, state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said the agency's looming financial problems are ""likely understated.""

“There is a lot at stake for riders and toll payers,"" DiNapoli said in a statement. ""The MTA must be transparent and communicate how its budget and capital plan choices will prioritize safety, frequency and reliability of the system to bring riders back and stabilize its finances.”",https://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/lirr-mta-yvnadmf2
"MTA turns to turnstile jumping crackdown, hires private security guards as way to combat subway crime",2022-10-26 00:00:00,"The MTA has quietly contracted unarmed private security guards to crack down on turnstile jumping — as a way to help tackle the recent wave of crime in the subway system, officials said Wednesday.

MTA CEO Janno Lieber said the pilot program was launched at six stations a couple of weeks ago, with the guards stationed at emergency exits.

“Overwhelmingly, the criminals are fare evaders, so if we do a decent job of discouraging fare evasion and stopping people who are engaged in it, we’re going to catch a lot of criminals,” he told authority board members during their monthly meeting, echoing the “broken windows theory” of policing rejected by many of his fellow Democrats.

“It is very much first and foremost a safety initiative,” Lieber said of the farebeating crackdown.

He added, without offering statistics, “Not every fare evader is a criminal, but experience has shown that virtually every criminal is a fare evader.”

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, straphangers are more likely to be victims of felony crime, while homicides underground have skyrocketed, according to NYPD statistics.

Recent subway crime victims include a good Samaritan who was stabbed trying to break up a fight, a woman robbed of her cellphone by a group of teen girls and a grandfather who was shoved onto the subway tracks.

“I paid $2.75 to the MTA so a guy could bash me in the head and throw me in the middle of the tracks,” the grandpa, 62-year-old Ronald Baptiste, railed to The Post on Tuesday.

“I want to be able to walk into the subway system and feel safe.”

Lieber said the introduction of unarmed guards came as a result of the work of a “blue-ribbon panel” he formed in May to tackle fare evasion, but did not have underlying data readily available.

The initial pilot, which launched at a half-dozen stations including the Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Ave/74th St. and West 4th St. stations, has resulted in fewer far evaders, officials said. It will be expanded at a pace of 50 additional guards per month.

“Across those six stations, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in fares being paid in just the last six to eight weeks,” MTA New York City Transit President Rich Davey told MTA board members regarding what he described as “a pilot that we have quietly been doing the last few months without much fanfare.”

Transit officials did not immediately provide a cost estimate for the unarmed guards, who are being paid through a third-party contractor.

Agency leaders have been focusing on fare-beating as an anti-crime strategy since at least 2018. Bloomberg via Getty Images

As of May, the MTA estimated it was on track to lose $500 million to fare evasion this year.

Pressed on whether the MTA had been able to reduce the amount of money lost to turnstile jumping since the launch of the panel, Lieber said it was “too soon” to say.

MTA board member David Jones, who runs the anti-poverty organization Community Service Society, welcomed the shift away from NYPD taking the lead on fare enforcement.

“I’ve been calling for unarmed personnel for six years,” Jones said. “It’s consistent with other systems through the world, where this kind of way of dealing with fare evasion is not given over to highly paid and high experienced and trained police officers.”

Lieber on Saturday stood with his boss Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams to announce the “Cops, Cameras, Care” initiative amid a record-setting year for transit homicide.

The announcement was one of several in recent years in which officials pledged to add more police patrols to the subway — but Lieber begged the public for patience.

“This is a process,” he said. “Some of this has been tried before, but it has been incremental.

“We’ve got to make the riders feel safe again — that’s the bottom line — what they’re telling us [is] they want to see more police. That’s what they’re telling us.”",https://nypost.com/2022/10/26/mta-turns-to-turnstile-jumping-crackdown-as-way-to-combat-subway-crime/

MTA’s private security guards watch and do nothing as fare-beaters stream past turnstiles,2022-10-28 00:00:00,"Private security guards hired by the MTA to help curb soaring subway crime told The Post on Friday they are there just to “observe” and alert cops to issues — but some of them appeared to even fail at that.

The pilot project, which sources said is costing taxpayers a couple million dollars, included two security guards manning both exits at the West Fourth Street subway station in Manhattan on Friday morning.

At one point, a fare-beater hopped the turnstile right in front of the guards — who looked on and did nothing.

“We are here as more of a deterrence. We can call dispatch, that’s about it,” one of the guards told The Post when asked if they are supposed to confront or chase after fare beaters.

It did not appear that the guards even called dispatch.

At the Roosevelt Avenue/103rd Street station in Queens, the security guards there also watched and did nothing as a stream of fare-beaters hopped the turnstile and walked through emergency exits at one entrance.

4 Private security for the MTA said they are there to just “observe.” J. Messerschmidt/NY Post

The two guards on duty at the station were only positioned at one of of its two entrances, leaving the other entryway unmanned — and scofflaws to openly flout the rules there, too.

“Honestly, when we’re standing here, they still jump the turnstile, curse at us. They try to push us out the way. It’s not worth it,” one of the guards said.

On Thursday, the MTA revealed that it had hired private security guards for a number of Big Apple subway stations to crack down on fare-evaders, many of whom they claim end up committing serious crimes underground.

The unarmed hired hands are on duty in shifts between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. Monday through Friday at stations including: West Fourth; Myrtle and Wyckoff, Halsey Street and Wyckoff Avenue in Brooklyn, and Roosevelt Avenue/103rd St. and Jackson Heights/ Roosevelt Avenue in Queens, law enforcement sources said.

The private guards, provided by Allied Universal, are making around $23 an hour, one of them said, and the program is costing taxpayers a couple of million dollars, sources said.

At the next MTA board meeting in November, members will decide how much more the program should expand, sources said.

During a board meeting Thursday, MTA CEO Janno Lieber insisted the presence of the guards has reduced fare evasions — but the program doesn’t appear to have had any affect on that, and straphangers aren’t convinced it will work.

“It would be better if maybe they build shields that will prevent people from being pushed on the tracks. [The guards are] just standing there. People will jump turnstiles anyway. [The scofflaws] don’t really care,” said Willa Lin, 22, at the West Fourth station.

4 The pilot project, according to sources, is costing taxpayers several million dollars. J. Messerschmidt/NY Post

“Honestly it’s not that safe,” Lin added. “I’m not sure what is the best way to do it, but they need to invest in more safety measures. I am Asian, and we are exposed to even more crimes. … I am much more conscious about my safety [these days].”

Vincent Flores, a Manhattan student, said he doesn’t think the plan will be effective, either.

“They increased police presence on the subway, but that hasn’t stopped stabbings and people being pushed on the tracks. Lately, the mood in the city has been attacking. I’m gay, and recently people on the streets have shouted slurs at me,” said Flores, 19.

“[While on the subway] I know I can’t have my music on high volume. When I walk down into the subway [at the West Fourth station], I see people shooting heroin in their legs.”

On Friday, Mayor Eric Adams was asked by a reporter at an unrelated press conference about the MTA’s move.

4 Vincent Flores said he’s skeptical of the plan. J. Messerschmidt/NY Post

He dodged the question, instead only responding that the NYPD is doing an “amazing job” making subways safer — even as major felonies continue to skyrocket on the rails.

Hizzoner pointed out that subway crime these days is technically lower than it was in 2019 and prior years — while failing to mention that in reality, straphangers are more likely to be victimized now than they were in the past when low ridership numbers are taken into account.

“Now what’s fascinating is that the last time we had real ridership was in 2019. Our index crimes are lower than 2019, 2018, 2017 and the last 10 year period,” Adams said when asked about the new security guards.

“So the numbers bear out that the officers are doing an amazing job, but that means nothing if people don’t feel safe, and the best way to do that is to have the omnipresence of our officers.”

While there are on average six felony crimes on the rails each day, a number Adams wants to reduce to zero, he once again said they’re fighting perception that the transit system is unsafe.

“We’re also dealing with how people are feeling. We have 3.5 million riders and I’m gonna keep saying this over and over again, 3.5 million people use our subway system and they get to and from their destination with no problems at all,” he said.

“But, if you are seeing disorder, if you are seeing people loud, disruptive, a person acting disorderly, it’s going to play into what you’re feeling.”

He said one way to make people feel safe is to have “uniformed presence” on the rails, which is why the NYPD has been dispatching 1,000 extra cops on the subways each day, many of whom are working overtime to fill the quota.

4 “It would be better if maybe they build shields that will prevent people from being pushed on the tracks,” said Willa Lin. J. Messerschmidt/NY Post

Even though transit crime continues to tick up, he said the plan is helping straphangers feel safer while commuting.

“People stop me, they say ‘we feel better when we see that uniformed officer walking through the trains. We see some former security personnel,’” Adams said.

“So we know that uniform allows people to feel safer and we want to do everything possible… we have to address what people are feeling and that’s the goal.”

MTA modifying turnstiles to recapture $45.6M in skipped fares,2023-07-17 00:00:00,"The MTA is slowly modifying turnstiles throughout the system to keep would-be fare-jumpers from slipping through.

Maintenance teams have begun making adjustments to the turnstile mechanism to keep people from “back-cocking” the fare gates — pulling backward on a turnstile arm just far enough to slip through.

“We’ve all seen it — someone pulls back on the bar just far enough to step over it when reversing to go in a forward direction,” Demetrius Crichlow, the MTA’s senior vice president of subways, said at a board meeting.

“This modification restricts the back turn of the turnstile and closes the gap that people regularly use to evade the fare,” he explained.

Costumers make their way through the turnstiles of the Columbus Circle subway station.

Fare evasion on the subway system cost the MTA $285 million last year, according to the agency’s May fare evasion report.

Of that, Crichlow said, $45.6 million in skipped fares is due to turnstile back-cocking.

In a video shown at Monday’s board meeting, the modified turnstiles appear to thwart a man who tries to slip through two different machines at the Bowling Green station.

MTA officials said only 26 turnstiles have been modified so far.

The agency plans to have about 240 turnstiles modified by September, MTA spokesman Tim Minton told the Daily News, and to have the upgrade installed in all 3,479 turnstiles throughout the system by the middle of 2025.

“We could probably expedite it if we hired additional folks,” Crichlow said when asked if the work could be done faster, “but we don’t have the additional resources to hire people for this project.”

The undertaking will cost about $2 million, he said.

“Even if we get a portion of that back, it will save the company a ton of money,” Crichlow noted.

The subway head acknowledged that the changes do not keep would-be back-cockers from becoming turnstile-jumpers.

Report on direct action in New York following mass police shooting. Originally posted to social media.

Tonight, New Yorkers stood up for their community and protested the expansion and impunity of the police occupation of their city. Last Sunday, the NYPD shot Derrell Mickles and three others after Mickles entered the platform through the emergency exit at the Sutter Ave. station in Brownsville—committing a mass shooting in one of New York City’s poorest neighborhoods.

In response, hundreds of city residents conducted a mass fare evasion at the West 4th station, hopping the turnstiles to say clearly that no one should be killed for not having $2.90, that in fact the subway should be free—and free of cops.

For their part, the NYPD were once again humiliated and shown to be paper tigers when confronted by the ingenuity and mass action of the city. As dozens streamed through the gates, onto the platforms, and into the different subway cars, cops brutalized and arrested those few they could get their hands on. The people are undeterred and are committed to maintaining this form of mass action in the weeks to come.

An institution founded from the slave patrols past, the NYPD protects property and capital, it funnels black and immigrant populations into endless cycles of immiseration and poverty and modern enslavement.

Our cities are under occupation: cop training facilities are flourishing all across America—we have one in our backyard near College Point Queens. These facilities advance and refine strategies of repression and counterinsurgency, so as to ensure that no mass action against oppression, incarceration, and depredation will be allowed to exist.

We must end this. Out of the homes and into the streets. Live free, ride free, fuck the NYPD.

MTA rolling out 5 fare-free bus routes beginning Sunday in each NYC borough,2023-09-23 00:00:00,"Riders will be getting a free ride beginning Sunday on five New York City bus routes.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is rolling out a $15 million, taxpayer-funded pilot program on one route in each of the five boroughs.

The free rides are expected to last anywhere from six to 12 months.

The fare-free pilot program — which doesn’t include Brooklyn’s B25 route (shown in photo) — will run anywhere from six to 12 months on five routes, one per borough. Paul Martinka

The routes are:

Bronx: The BX18 A/B, which runs from a loop from High Bridge to Morris Heights

Brooklyn: The B60, which runs from Canarsie all the way to Williamsburg

Manhattan: The crosstown M116 that links Central and East Harlem

Queens: The Q4 that runs along Linden Blvd, Merrick Blvd and Archer Avenue

Staten Island: And the S46 that runs between the St. George Ferry Terminal and the West Shore Plaza Shopping Center and its limited stop twin, S96

The program will begin Sunday on five New York City bus routes. Paul Martinka

The transit lines were selected based on several factors: overall ridership, fare evasion, fairness for lower socio-economic communities, and commercial activity.

The pilot will not include free transfers to buses or subway lines.

The free bus service is expected to serve 43,900 riders per weekday.",https://nypost.com/2023/09/23/mta-rolling-out-5-fare-free-bus-routes-beginning-sunday-in-each-nyc-borough/
MTA modifying turnstiles to recapture $45.6M in skipped fares,2023-07-17 00:00:00,"The MTA is slowly modifying turnstiles throughout the system to keep would-be fare-jumpers from slipping through.

Maintenance teams have begun making adjustments to the turnstile mechanism to keep people from “back-cocking” the fare gates — pulling backward on a turnstile arm just far enough to slip through.

“We’ve all seen it — someone pulls back on the bar just far enough to step over it when reversing to go in a forward direction,” Demetrius Crichlow, the MTA’s senior vice president of subways, said at a board meeting.

“This modification restricts the back turn of the turnstile and closes the gap that people regularly use to evade the fare,” he explained.

Costumers make their way through the turnstiles of the Columbus Circle subway station.

Fare evasion on the subway system cost the MTA $285 million last year, according to the agency’s May fare evasion report.

Of that, Crichlow said, $45.6 million in skipped fares is due to turnstile back-cocking.

In a video shown at Monday’s board meeting, the modified turnstiles appear to thwart a man who tries to slip through two different machines at the Bowling Green station.

MTA officials said only 26 turnstiles have been modified so far.

The agency plans to have about 240 turnstiles modified by September, MTA spokesman Tim Minton told the Daily News, and to have the upgrade installed in all 3,479 turnstiles throughout the system by the middle of 2025.

“We could probably expedite it if we hired additional folks,” Crichlow said when asked if the work could be done faster, “but we don’t have the additional resources to hire people for this project.”

The undertaking will cost about $2 million, he said.

“Even if we get a portion of that back, it will save the company a ton of money,” Crichlow noted.

The subway head acknowledged that the changes do not keep would-be back-cockers from becoming turnstile-jumpers.

But Crichlow said his department is exploring additional deterrents, from sleeves that heighten turnstile arms to large vertical panels between the machines, all meant to make it harder to vault over the fare gate.

Additionally, the MTA has removed a slew of locks on emergency gates that were accessible with an easily obtained master key that circulated among employees. Only the FDNY now has keyed access to the emergency gates, Crichlow said.

Fare evasion causing New York City’s MTA hundreds of millions in losses Singapore News,2023-11-24 21:59:29+08:00,"Fare evasion on New York City’s transit systems is reaching concerning levels, causing significant financial losses for the MTA. Recent data reveals a disturbing surge, notably with almost half of bus commuters and about 14% of subway travellers skipping fare payments. Public transportation is one of the most important sectors for a city like New York. To have it operate in losses would not help the city in any way.

According to the New York Post, the latest statistics show a troubling 4% increase in bus fare evasion since May, reaching a staggering 41%. Meanwhile, subway turnstile jumping has peaked at 14%, marking the highest recorded rate in five years. Last year’s estimated cost of $690 million due to fare dodging may surpass this figure in the current year.

MTA Chairman Janno Lieber has prioritised the fight against fare evasion, putting in place a number of measures to address this financial burden, such as increased security and possible redesigns of turnstiles. Lisa Daglian, a panellist who tracks fare evasion occurrences, stressed the seriousness of the matter by noting that each fare that is evaded amounts to $2.90, money that might be used to pay for essential transportation services.

The MTA has not yet released an estimate of the current rise in fare evasion, but its future budget proposal seeks to address these losses. Increasing enforcement and investigating technology developments in turnstile design are two measures taken to lessen fare skipping, though it’s unclear when these will take place.

MTA’s approach to rectify this problem

New Yorkers will adapt and overcome. Their bodies will evolve to be thinner, more narrow, and continue to evade the MTA — Matt Herrmann (@MattyHerrmann) May 19, 2023

During the middle of this year, the MTA suggests a plan in order to reduce those who are dodging their fares. A new system of gates where passengers can’t easily walk pass by without paying or verifying a ticket might be in place. However, this new fancy technology will also cost a lot of money.

X users joke that New Yorkers will continue to evade fares and will evolve to escape the machines. Furthermore, others state that they will be thinner in order to surpass these new security measures.

And the fare is going up — Melody ♡ (haha) (@melodyskatess) July 21, 2023

There are some talks that they will start using Artificial Intelligence in order to track down fare evaders. However, some New Yorkers are complaining that the fares they are charging are quite high and it could be unaffordable for some living in the city.
